Aerobic exercise refers to the type of repetitive, structured physical activity that requires the body’s metabolic system to use oxygen to produce energy. Over time these demands result in adaptations to the respiratory system (such as ventilation/breathing rate, lung capacity/volume, respiratory muscles, etc.) and to the cardiovascular system (such as heart size, stroke volume,.
