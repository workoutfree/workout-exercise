Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) during exercise in subjects From researchgate.net
Maximal walking distance was determined by an exercise treadmill test. The reduction in resting systolic (sbp) and diastolic (dbp) blood pressure immediately after a bout of aerobic exercise was noted by kaul et al. This is illustrated on the adjacent graph. Individuals with suspected cardiovascular disease or any other type of disease that may produce an abnormal response to exercise should be appropriately screened and tested before the initiation of an exercise program.
