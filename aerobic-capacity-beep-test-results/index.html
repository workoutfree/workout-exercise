Our apps will calculate your exact distance based on your score. The values usually measured in tm tests, vo 2 and peak cardiac power output (cpo max) , (fletcher et al, 1995), give an idea about an individual’s aerobic capacity, and are used as data for many different studies. Whatever the name, the test is a standardised assessment of a person’s fitness levels. The test was described by researchers at the rehabilitation centre de hoogstraat, utrecht, the netherlands (verschuren et al., 2006).
