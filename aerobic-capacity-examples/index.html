<p>This enhances muscle strength and endurance, generating hypertrophy. Aerobic capacity, also called maximal oxygen uptake, is characterized by the amount of oxygen the body produces and circulates to all major organs to regulate systemic homeostasis. For example, exercise intensely for 1 minute at 85% of maximum heart rate and then recover for 2 minutes at 55% of maximum heart rate. This measurement is an indication of (1) the ability of the cardiovascular system to provide oxygen to working muscles and (2) the ability of those muscles to extract oxygen for energy generation in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp).
