<p>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of aerobic physical training (apt) on heart rate variability (hrv) and cardiorespiratory responses at peak condition and ventilatory anaerobic threshold. To achieve a lower resting heart rate from exercise, you should exercise at least 150 minutes a week in your aerobic zone. Helps to better control blood sugar. The best heart rate zone for aerobic exercise is between 50 percent and 75 percent of your maximum heart rate.</p>
