Aerobic Anaerobic Respiration Presentation Biology From sliderbase.com
This type of respiration is common in most of the plants and animals, birds, humans, and other mammals. Improves your circulation and helps your body use oxygen better. Respiration is used by all cells to turn fuel into energy that can be used to power cellular processes. Aerobic respiration is a type of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen, while anaerobic respiration is a type of cellular respiration that takes place in the absence of oxygen.
