List The Similarities Between Aerobic And Anaerobic Respiration malaylolo From malayloloo.blogspot.com
Many cells can perform either aerobic or anaerobic respiration, depending on. 1) carbon dioxide and water are the end products of aerobic respiration, while alcohol or lactic acid is the end product of anaerobic respiration. The alcohol fermentation and aerobic respiration both involve the glycolysis reaction.the alcohol formation is initiated due to anaerobic conditions without oxygen, this reaction involves the conversion of sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide by the action of yeast. There’s really no similarity except that neither one requires oxygen, but they interact and each of them “feeds” the other.
