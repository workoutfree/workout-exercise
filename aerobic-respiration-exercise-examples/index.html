The examples of aerobic respiration are: After a few minutes, your aerobic system takes over. It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food. Aerobic exercise can be sustained for a prolonged period of time because there is lots of glucose available and no great build.
