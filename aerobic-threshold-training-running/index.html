<meta name="description" content="20 Min Aerobic Threshold Training Running For Girls, This tells us that another term we often hear when looking at training, the lactate threshold, is part of the anaerobic threshold. Here’s a fartlek training program for an amateur runner before a race:
What Pace Should Runners Run LactateThreshold Workouts? From 091runcrw.mk
However, for increasing aerobic power and raising the anaerobic threshold, training at the threshold is likely to be more beneficial than training significantly above it. Training your aerobic threshold is arguably more important than training your anaerobic threshold when it comes to endurance sports. Hold yourself accountable to aerobic threshold for most of your running. Most of your training should be below aerobic threshold.

<p>The aerobic threshold is the uppermost limit of exercise when the production of energy starts to become dominated by anaerobic glycolysis (sugars) rather than the oxidation (aerobic in nature) of fats. Training your aerobic threshold is arguably more important than training your anaerobic threshold when it comes to endurance sports.
