<p>Anaerobic intervals for cycling are short high powered efforts that do not use oxygen. Aerobic capacity, also called maximal oxygen uptake, is characterized by the amount of oxygen the body produces and circulates to all major organs to regulate systemic homeostasis.

<p>Aerobic capacity, also called maximal oxygen uptake, is characterized by the amount of oxygen the body produces and circulates to all major organs to regulate systemic homeostasis. The anaerobic threshold is the lowest intensity of exercise at which the production of lactate exceeds the body’s ability to utilize lactate as fuel in aerobic metabolism. Philosophical argument is used to support the proposed definitions and systems view, which is an approach to assist in the universal acceptance of such terms.

<p>It is believed that aerobic capacity is directly proportional to cardiorespiratory fitness based on heart rate factors often. Correct muscle imbalances and improve posture. It has been documented that there is a greater anaerobic capacity in men than women during maximal intensity exercise, both when absolute and bm corrected estimates of anaerobic capacity are applied. The anaerobic threshold is the lowest intensity of exercise at which the production of lactate exceeds the body’s ability to utilize lactate as fuel in aerobic metabolism.
