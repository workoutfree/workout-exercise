<p>In practical terms, this means that anaerobic exercise is more intense, but shorter in duration than aerobic exercise. Increase muscle strength and power. During exercise, the oxygen consumption above which aerobic energy production is supplemented by anaerobic mechanisms, causing a sustained increase in lactate and metabolic acidosis, is termed the anaerobic threshold (at).

Anaerobic exercise is a type of exercise that breaks down glucose in the body without using oxygen; Identification of the duration and/or intensity of a physical activity in order to identify and justify why it would be aerobic or anaerobic, eg marathon (aerobic), sprint.

<p>Correct muscle imbalances and improve posture. Laboratory studies of aerobic and anaerobic exercise have revealed much about the mechanisms that sustain swimming, and what sets the energetic limits for each type of activity. The use of aerobic and anaerobic exercise in practical examples of differing intensities link practical examples of sporting situations to aerobic or anaerobic exercise. In practical terms, this means that anaerobic exercise is more intense, but shorter in duration than aerobic exercise. Anaerobic Energy Production During Exercise Occurs During A Process.</p>
