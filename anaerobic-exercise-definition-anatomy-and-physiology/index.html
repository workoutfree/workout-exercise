Anaerobic exercise is a type of exercise that breaks down glucose in the body without using oxygen; Identification of the duration and/or intensity of a physical activity in order to identify and justify why it would be aerobic or anaerobic, eg marathon (aerobic), sprint. Infections like tetanus and gangrene are caused by anaerobic bacteria. Pin by Bashoy Boyoris on Energy system Energy system, Exercise.</p>

<p>Correct muscle imbalances and improve posture. Laboratory studies of aerobic and anaerobic exercise have revealed much about the mechanisms that sustain swimming, and what sets the energetic limits for each type of activity. The use of aerobic and anaerobic exercise in practical examples of differing intensities link practical examples of sporting situations to aerobic or anaerobic exercise. In practical terms, this means that anaerobic exercise is more intense, but shorter in duration than aerobic exercise. Anaerobic Energy Production During Exercise Occurs During A Process.</p>
