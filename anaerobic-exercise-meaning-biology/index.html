biochemistry How does the body switch between aerobic and anaerobic From biology.stackexchange.com
Anaerobic activity (like strength training) can increase the strength and density of bones, decreasing the risk of osteoporosis.; This is in contrast to the highly efficient process of aerobic respiration, which relies on oxygen to produce energy. Anaerobic creatures or processes do not need oxygen in order to function or survive. In an ordinary aerobic workout, the body can utilize up oxygen and also this is this is of aerobic metabolism.
