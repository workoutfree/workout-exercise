In strenuous, short term anaerobic exercise, the glycogen store in a muscle lasts only some 20 s, and this terminates the activity. After age 27, you start to lose about 1% of your muscle mass each year. Anaerobic exercise is said to strengthen muscles, increase joint mobility and reduce risk of musculoskeletal injury. The difference between aerobic and anaerobic training is the fuel source.

<p>In practical terms, this means that anaerobic exercise is more intense, but shorter in duration than aerobic exercise. Anaerobic training is more intense and demands a faster energy source. That uses oxygen to make energy) generally results in greater amounts of calories being burned during a given amount of time, as compared to highly anaerobic exercise. Therefore, the body produces and then uses lactate as its fuel source, fed by glycogen.</p>

<p>Anaerobic exercise is any activity that breaks down glucose for energy without using oxygen. Anaerobic exercise is said to strengthen muscles, increase joint mobility and reduce risk of musculoskeletal injury.

The anaerobic threshold is a term coined in 1964 by karl wasserman when he used vo 2 measurements to show a change in the gas curve that seemed to correspond with an increase in lactate in the blood. In these cases, other energy sources must be used. Continuous ‘steady state’ exercise is performed aerobically.</p>
