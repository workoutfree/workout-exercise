<p>In this case, speed is considered as the tip of the ice berg. The anaerobic threshold is the lowest intensity of exercise at which the production of lactate exceeds the body’s ability to utilize lactate as fuel in aerobic metabolism. Anaerobic literally means “without air,” so anaerobic exercise is an intense exercise that requires the body to use other sources of energy besides oxygen to fuel the muscles. Used for warmups and warmdowns, recovery workouts, and easy workouts that add to aerobic base.</p>
