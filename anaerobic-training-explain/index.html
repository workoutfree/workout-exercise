<p>To start an anaerobic workout, like weightlifting, warm up for 5 minutes, either walking, stretching, or jogging. Certain circumstances require the body to produce energy faster than oxygen delivery can take place. Anaerobic exercise is similar to aerobic exercise but uses a different form of energy — quickly and immediately. Aerobic, means with oxygen, therefore while you’re training in an aerobic state, your body has a sufficient amount of oxygen to provide the energy which is necessary to sustain an exercise for a prolonged period of time, without tapping into other energy.
