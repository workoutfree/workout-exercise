What&#39;s the best workouts for PCOS⁉️⁣ ⁣ If you&#39;re feeling frustrated From pinterest.com
You can follow any workouts on youtube or in your gym. I recommend that women start strength training by doing a total body workout 3 times a week. A study that followed 54 men for 6 months, exercising 4 times/wk for 1 hour (at 70% v_o2 max) showed they lost an average of just 1.8kg in that time. Another form of aerobic exercise that can be done indoors or out is cycling.
