<p>Therefore, it is important to investigate the different responses to different training methods. Resistance training (rt) may be an efficient tool to mitigate such neuromuscular decline and different rt methods can be used. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the effect of resistance training (rt) alone or combined with multimodal exercise intervention on muscle hypertrophy, maximal strength, power output, functional performance, and falls incidence in physically frail elderly. Based on these results, resistance training should be considered as a highly effective preventive strategy to delay and attenuate the negative effects of sarcopenia and frailty in both early and.
