900 Women&#39;s Fitness Cardio Training ZipUp Sports Bra Black From decathlon.my
This sports bra offers maximum support by lifting and supporting each breast. High neck sports bras have the bonus of providing extra coverage, keeping everything tucked in, and stopping you from feeling too exposed. The best sports bras for low intensity exercise like yoga, ballet or walking are light support bras. Thanks to the added length, it provides a boost of coverage and works well as a top but is still perfect for a variety of workouts.
