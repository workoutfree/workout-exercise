High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) the Best Cardio to Burn Calories From entrenar.me
Start with the feet together or no more than 3 inches (in) apart. High intensity interval training (or hiit) isn’t only aerobic exercise. Get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity — such as brisk walking, swimming or mowing the lawn — or 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity — such as running or aerobic dancing. Low intensity exercise, however, is lower impact and lower aerobic activity.
