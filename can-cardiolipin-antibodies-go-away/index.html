The antiphospholipid syndrome often overlooked cause of vascular From onlinelibrary.wiley.com
Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of blood fat that is important for blood clotting. There are actually three types of cardiolipin. Cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies. Cardiolipin antibodies are autoantibodies produced by the immune system that mistakenly target the body’s own cardiolipins, substances found in the outermost layer of cells (cell membranes) and platelets.

<p>Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of blood fat that is important for blood clotting. According to some research, cardiolipin antibodies can be detected in about 1% to 5% of healthy individuals. When the antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can occur. The igm antibody recognizes a large variety of pathogenic antigens and plays an important role in body immunity.</p>

Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood that is important for blood clotting. The levels of these antibodies are often high in people with abnormal blood.
