Cardiac tamponade ECG Cardiac, Heart failure, Pericardial effusion From pinterest.co.uk
Constrictive pericarditis and cardiac tamponade both manifest as specific forms of heart failure with preserved systolic function. Pericardial effusion is a buildup of fluid in the space around the heart. The association of atrial arrhythmias with cardiac tamponade is rare in the literature, and the association with malignant pericardial effusion is even rarer. Two cases in the literature report cardiac tamponade with atrial fibrillation as the first manifestation of malignancy—both were lymphoid in origin.
