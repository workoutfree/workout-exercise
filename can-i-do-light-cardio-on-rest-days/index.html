<p>You don't want to be doing cardio for another 30+ min when your muscles need nutrients. Let me explain how those 2 options work. Making the most of your days off (3 rest day best practices) let’s do this. Typically, rest days aren’t necessary for light cardio. Cardio Workout 4 Active Rest Day SELF.</p>
<h3 id="is-it-ok-to-do-cardio-on-rest-days">Is It Ok To Do Cardio On Rest Days?</h3><p>Let me explain how those 2 options work. Well cardio is also good for mitochondrial density, capilarisation, neurogenisis in the muscles, red blood cell count, etc. Next, increase the gradient to 5% and increase your walking speed to 6km/h for 10 minutes. They are important to prevent injury and for your body to recover and repair itself after physically demanding workouts and as such you’ll need to judge how often to take them.</p>
<h3 id="including-rest-days-in-your-workout-routine-can-help-lessen-the-chances-of-overuse-injuries-and-give-your-body-time-to-recover">Including Rest Days In Your Workout Routine Can Help Lessen The Chances Of Overuse Injuries And Give Your Body Time To Recover.</h3><p>The basic trick is getting to know your own body and how it is reacting to the exercise. Like someone else said on your rest days you might take in a little more calories and do your cardio that day to use those extra calories for energy and just drink some recovery drink to continue to recovery the muscles from the workout the day before. Just make sure you are eating enough and don't push yourself to silly levels. Train heavy with basic exercises and seek to add weight to your lifts.</p>
<h3 id="how-fit-is-enough-for-you">How Fit Is Enough For You?</h3><p>Walking isn’t going to interfere with recovery on rest days. Even if you're trying to put on muscle, cardio on rest days is ok. By light active rest i’m referring to doing something of the sort of light cardio or to focus on training muscle groups that don’t get much workout during the week. Walk like this for 5 minutes.</p>
<h3 id="rowing-every-time-will-over-work-your-back-reducing-your-recovery">Rowing Every Time Will Over Work Your Back, Reducing Your Recovery.</h3><p>Are you going out for the olympics? When i hear questions like this, i have to ask the following questions in return. Typically, rest days aren’t necessary for light cardio. I think light cardio like walking is a great idea!</p>
