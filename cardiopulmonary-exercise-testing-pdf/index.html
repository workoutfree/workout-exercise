<p>Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet or cpex), also referred to as a vo2 (oxygen consumption) test, is a specialized type of stress test or exercise test that measures your exercise ability. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet) is the most comprehensive tool used to gather information on the interplay between muscular, cardiac and respiratory limitations. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing was next considered to determine whether a cardiovascular or pulmonary limitation to exercise was present.
