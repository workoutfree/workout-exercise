<p>This chapter presents the committee's review of the scientific literature that explores the relationship between specific field tests of cardiorespiratory endurance and health outcomes in youth. Cardio fitness measures how well your body can perform a rhythmic, dynamic activity at a moderate to high intensity for extended periods of time. This method uses confirmatory factor analysis and analyzes the influencing factors of motor skills. While cardio exercise is great for burning calories and losing weight, it also improves your cardiovascular fitness.</p>
