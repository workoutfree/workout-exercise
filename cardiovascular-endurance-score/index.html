Typically, health and fitness experts use cardiovascular endurance as a predictive measure for lung and heart health. Cardiovascular endurance, otherwise known as aerobic endurance, measures how well you can exercise for a prolonged period. To achieve cardiovascular endurance, you should exercise aerobically 30 minutes per day, 3 to 7 days per week. While cardio exercise is great for burning calories and losing weight, it also improves your cardiovascular fitness.
