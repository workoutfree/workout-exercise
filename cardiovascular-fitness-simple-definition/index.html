There are two basic ways to measure exercise intensit.the definition of cardiovascular fitness is the capacity of the cardiovascular system (heart, lungs and vessels) to efficiently supply oxygenated blood to working muscles, as well as the muscles to use the oxygen delivered by the blood supply as a source of energy for movement.cardiovascular. Cardiovascular exercise is any vigorous activity that increases heart rate and respiration and raises oxygen and blood flow throughout the body while using large muscle groups of the body repetitively and rhythmically. In simple words, crf estimates how much the body requires taking in oxygen and transfers to the muscles and organs, throughout the intense exercises. Sometimes it is known as cardiorespiratory fitness (crf).
