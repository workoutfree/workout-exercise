The body’s demand for oxygen changes, such as during exercise, and the cardiac output is altered by modulating both heart rate (hr) and stroke volume (sv). It is measured in liters per minute, and it is dependent upon the heart rate and stroke volume. Fluid restriction decreases the extracellular fluid volume and reduces demands on the heart. Cardiac output the effective volume of blood expelled by either ventricle of the.
