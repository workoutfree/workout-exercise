<p>In strenuous, short term anaerobic exercise, the glycogen store in a muscle lasts only some 20 s, and this terminates the activity. In practical terms, this means that anaerobic exercise is more intense, but shorter in duration than aerobic exercise. The body uses this oxygen to break down energy sources like fats and glucose to release energy we can use to perform the exercise. Certain circumstances require the body to produce energy faster than oxygen delivery can take place.</p>
