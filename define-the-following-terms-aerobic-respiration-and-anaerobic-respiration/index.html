<p>In contrast, anaerobic respiration does not use oxygen. On the other hand, anaerobic bacteria, yeast cells, prokaryotes, and muscle cells perform anaerobic respiration. It is also called fermentation. Respiration is the process of breaking down complex organic compounds and producing energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate.
