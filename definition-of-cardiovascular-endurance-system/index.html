<p>The definition of cardiovascular endurance simply put is the body’s ability to continue exertion while getting energy from the aerobic system used to supply the body with energy. Ang cardiovascular endurance ay ang kakayanan ng puso, baga at daluyan ng dugo para makapaghatid ng oxygen sa iba't ibang parte ng katawan ng tao.kung ang ating circulatory system ay nakakapagpadala ng sapat na oxygen sa mga tisyu ng katawan, mas mababa ang magiging breathing rate. Studies show that eating the right amount of carbohydrates (cho) such as rice, pasta, bread can help improve your cardio. This is because cardiovascular activities mainly rely on carbohydrates to provide the energy needed, so consuming the proper amount can be beneficial.</p>
