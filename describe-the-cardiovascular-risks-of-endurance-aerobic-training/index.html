Endurance training can increase your maximal oxygen uptake, or vo2 max, which means your body learns to move and use oxygen with more efficiency during exercise.
One of the main aspects of endurance is cardiovascular performance From pinterest.com
Cardiovascular endurance examples include high impact activities, low impact activities, and no impact activities. The term cardiovascular uses the word cardio which means heart. As cardiac output at rest remains constant the increase in stroke volume is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in heart rate. Cardiac output (q) cardiac output increases significantly during maximal exercise effort due to the increase in sv.

<p>Also called aerobic exercise, endurance exercise includes activities that increase your breathing and heart rate such as walking, jogging, swimming, biking and jumping rope. Thus cardiovascular exercises help in improving the heart rate. Stroke volume (sv) is defined as the amount of blood ejected from the heartâs left ventricle during a single contraction and is measured in millilitres (ml) per beat. The aerobic zone will help to improve the bodyâs cardiovascular and respiratory systems. PPT Chapter 3 Increasing Cardiorespiratory Endurance PowerPoint.</p>
