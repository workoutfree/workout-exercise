<meta name="description" content="The 23 Step Describe The Cardiovascular Risks Of Endurance/Aerobic Training For Adults, Cardiac output (q) cardiac output increases significantly during maximal exercise effort due to the increase in sv. Endurance training can increase your maximal oxygen uptake, or vo2 max, which means your body learns to move and use oxygen with more efficiency during exercise.
One of the main aspects of endurance is cardiovascular performance From pinterest.com
Cardiovascular endurance examples include high impact activities, low impact activities, and no impact activities. The term cardiovascular uses the word cardio which means heart. As cardiac output at rest remains constant the increase in stroke volume is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in heart rate. Cardiac output (q) cardiac output increases significantly during maximal exercise effort due to the increase in sv.
