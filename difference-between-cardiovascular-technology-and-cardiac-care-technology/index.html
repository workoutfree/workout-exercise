They use medical technologies like ekg machines and sonography equipment to detect heart irregularities such as arterial blockages and hypertensive heart disease. The cardiovascular technologist is responsible for assisting the physician in invasive procedures such as cardiac catheterization. While a cardiac sonography program takes around 18 to 24 months to complete, diagnostic medical sonography programs will often take more than 2 years.
