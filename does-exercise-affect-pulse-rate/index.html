How does Exercise affect the pulse rate GCSE Science Marked by From markedbyteachers.com
A young, healthy athlete may have a heart rate of 30 to 40 bpm. Does exercising and running affect the pulse and why? Resting heart rate or pulse is a simple variable measured during a routine physical exam that can be indicative of factors such as age, training status, medication use and cardiovascular disease risk. When you exercise, including running, your heart rate will increase, meaning that your pulse will become faster because your body is under physical stress.
