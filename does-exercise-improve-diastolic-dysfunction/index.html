Poor disease control may lead to left ventricular (lv) systolic dysfunction and heart failure. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of exercise training on myocardial diastolic function in t2d patients without ischemic heart disease. Diastolic function is not evaluated routinely during stress echocardiography. However, this invasive procedure is not.

It's been known for some time that regular, moderate aerobic exercise can improve the diastolic function of the heart. The increase in diastolic blood pressure on exercise in our group of healthy active men ranged from −12 to 16 mm hg at the lowest workload when heart rates ranged from 71 to 136 bpm.

<p>Diastolic function is not evaluated routinely during stress echocardiography. Impairment of diastolic function could result in the inability to increase cardiac output adequately and can limit exercise capacity.
