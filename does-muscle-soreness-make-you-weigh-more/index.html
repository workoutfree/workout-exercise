The Weighin January 2014 From lifeofcouncil.blogspot.com
If you&#39;ve been working out hard in hopes of losing weight, but instead weigh more and appear thinner it may be because you have replaced body fat with lean muscle. Building muscle will help you in many ways not only in your appearance, it will make your body a fat burning machine, hgh levels will consistently be in production, and you will have more stamina and agility. You are made up of many things that contribute to the number you see on the scale including water, bone, tissue, fat, and muscle mass. The causes of soreness aren&#39;t entirely understood, but soreness by itself doesn&#39;t cause anything.
