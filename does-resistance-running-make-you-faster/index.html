<p>Hawkes studied running and determined that the amount of wasted energy spent pounding the pavement, braking, and accelerating could be mitigated by troubleshooting the cause of the wasted energy. Vo2max is the maximum amount of oxygen you can use when doing an intense exercise. You have to run with a resistance band strapped between your shoes. There is a balancing act here, because the more pounds you’re carrying on your frame, the more pounds you have to carry for the full distance of your run.
