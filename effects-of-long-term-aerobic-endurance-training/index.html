<p>Increased stroke volume (sv) at. Endurance training is the act of exercising to increase endurance.the term endurance training generally refers to training the aerobic system as opposed to the anaerobic system. It has, therefore, been hypothesized that aerobic training may interfere with the adaptive response to strength training. Measurements of ldh following exercise have been examined to seek evidence in support of the theory of muscle soreness. Exercise atrde.</p>
