<p>However, if the person is experiencing physical or emotional stress, the rhythm of the heart will be affected by autonomic control. According to some authors, training increases variability in heart rate, evidenced by greater energy lying flat in trained individuals than in those who are sedentary (3,9). What this means, is that although your heart might beat at 60 beats per minute, those beats are not happening perfectly every second on the second. 2155 | find, read and cite all the research you need on researchgate (PDF) Endurance training guided individually by daily heart rate.</p>
