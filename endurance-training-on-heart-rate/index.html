Training Metrics Power vs. Heart Rate Waite Endurance From waiteendurance.com
On any given training day, intense exercise will lead to a decrease in. Hrv and the training cycle. Also called aerobic exercise, endurance exercise includes activities that increase your breathing and heart rate such as walking, jogging, swimming, biking and jumping rope. An increase in hrv with a decrease in rhr (resting heart rate) generally means an athlete is coping well with training.

Endurance training is accompanied by a significant fall in resting heart rate (hr) (3,5,9,16,18,19,26).this is certainly due to a reduction in intrinsic heart rate, linked to stabilization of the cell conduction system membrane, as well as a high degree of vagal control of the sinus node.
