<p>The use of anaerobic digestion at wrrfs in the united states dates back to the early 1900’s. These processes take place in an enclosed building and involve the breakdown of organic material in a sealed vessel called a digester. Ad systems are most commonly known as biogas systems. Anaerobic digestion is a process through which bacteria break down organic matter—such as animal manure, wastewater biosolids, and food wastes—in the absence of oxygen.
