Also, students will be able to determine how many pounds of fish can be grown from a fixed amount of feed and link it to the. This tp amount is sufficient for shrimp to gain more weight and have more ability to convert the eaten feed into flesh. Provide the students with the formula for feed conversion, or feed to gain, ratio: For example, if it requires two kilograms of feed to grow one kilogram of fish, the fcr would be two.

<p>What is feed conversion ratio (fcr)? Aquaculture is an increasingly important source of safe, nutritious, and sustainable seafood for people worldwide. Usually, in ponds used for research, for a catfish that has been raised from fingerlings to the size of 1.5 or 1 pounds, the fcr is for about 1.8 or lower.

<p>By andrew fothergill, national poultry advisor at forfarmers. This tp amount is sufficient for shrimp to gain more weight and have more ability to convert the eaten feed into flesh. This means that when a feed has a low fcr, it takes less feed to produce one kilogram of fish then it would if the fcr were higher. One of used benchmarks in a level of effectiveness and efficiency of feeding programs is the food conversion ratio (fcr), which is a ratio between cumulative amount of feed that has been given to the shrimp compared with produced biomass at a certain time.for example: Production, crop duration, survival rates, and feed conversion ratio.</p>

The fcr is simply the amount of feed it takes to grow a kilogram of fish. The feed conversion factor (fcr) was similar between the two cycles, although somewhat high due to observed mortalities of large shrimp during the last weeks of the cycle and due to diseases.
