ATHLETIC Girl&#39;s Gymnastics Gymnastics by CreationsByFrannie Athletic From pinterest.com
Gymnastics is the equivalent to ενόργανη γυμναστική in greek, and i’m pretty sure you’ve heard it many times before already. The sport combines physical skills such as body control,. Many of these exercises came to be included in the olympic games, until the abandonment of the games in 393 ce. Traditionally, the sport encompasses calisthenics, tumbling, and floor exercises, as well as work on a variety of apparatuses, including the horizontal bars, (uneven) parallel bars, pommel.
