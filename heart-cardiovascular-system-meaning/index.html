Like the bustling factory, the body must have a transportation system to carry its various cargos back and forth, and this is where the cardiovascular system steps in. A cabg is an open heart surgery in which a vein is taken from a different part of the body (saphenous or mammary) and grafted into a section of a coronary artery to bypass a blockage. The cardiac electrical signal controls the heartbeat in two ways. The blood circulatory system is a system of organs that includes the heart, blood vessels, and blood which is circulated throughout the entire body of a human or other vertebrate.
