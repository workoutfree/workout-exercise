What&#39;s the Connection? Your Heart Can Affect Your Breathing From nationaljewish.org
Changes in cardiac output that are called for by physiologic conditions can be produced by changes in heart rate or stroke volume or both. Hot weather means your body has to work harder to keep its core temperature to normal levels, and this puts extra strain on your heart, lungs and kidneys. The american heart association notes that if you are calm, relaxed, not ill and are sitting or lying down, your resting heart rate is typically between 60 beats per minute and 100 bpm. Over time, with chronic cardio training, our resting heart rate drops because each beat delivers a bigger burst of blood, and fewer beats are needed.
