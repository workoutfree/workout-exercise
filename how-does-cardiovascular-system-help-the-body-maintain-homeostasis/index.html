This allows the mechanisms within the circulatory system to ensure that every cell maintains a constant and balanced internal environment! The lungs accomplish gas exchange by removing carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration. The respiratory system maintains homeostasis in two ways: Did you know the circulatory system comprises the heart, veins, capillaries.

<p>The circulatory system maintains homeostasis by the controlled and continuous flow of blood that reaches each cell in the body. The lungs accomplish gas exchange by removing carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration. Thus the healthy heart can pump more blood when there is more blood to pump. Homeostasis is the overall equilibrium of the bodyâs internal organs and functions.</p>

<p>Gas exchange is performed by the lungs by eliminating carbon dioxide, a waste product given off by cellular respiration. As carbon dioxide exits the body, oxygen needed for cellular respiration enters the body through the lungs. Gas exchange and blood ph adjustment. The respiratory system helps maintain homeostasis by regulating the intake of air into the body and by removing carbon dioxide from the blood, which in turn assists the circulatory systemâs function and many other operations in the body.
