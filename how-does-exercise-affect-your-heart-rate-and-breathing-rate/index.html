The heart rate increases during exercise. These cardiovascular benefits help manage cholesterol; Some of them are lower resting heart rate, ability to perform deep breaths, increased calories burn, and reduced heart disease risk. In addition to that, if you are exercising on a hot day, then too, the high temperature coupled with the vigorous activity performed by your heart will result in an abnormal increase in your heart rate.

<p>Aerobic exercise improves circulation, which results in lowered blood pressure and heart rate, stewart says. These gases are exchanged with the atmosphere when you breathe. Both your pulse and breathing rate increase with exercise, maintaining a ratio of approximately 1 breath for every 4. These include decreased resting heart rate, improved ability to draw in deeper breaths, reduced resting blood pressure, increased calories burned to aid weight loss and reduced risk of heart disease.</p>

<p>Your muscles are pushing your blood back to your heart at a faster rate, so your heart must increase its rate of pumping to match. When you exercise and your muscles work harder, your body uses more oxygen and produces more carbon dioxide. This need means that your heart starts pumping faster, which makes for a quicker pulse. Your brain counters with an increase in heart rate, but if dehydration continues, heart rate will continually. PPT Aerobic respiration and exercise PowerPoint Presentation, free.</p>

<p>Dehydration also increases heart rate during exercise. The lungs also benefit from exercise by getting more air into them and therefore flushing out mucus and other debris. Exercise can help you live a healthy life and have a controlled weight.
