The heart rate increases during exercise. These cardiovascular benefits help manage cholesterol; Some of them are lower resting heart rate, ability to perform deep breaths, increased calories burn, and reduced heart disease risk. In addition to that, if you are exercising on a hot day, then too, the high temperature coupled with the vigorous activity performed by your heart will result in an abnormal increase in your heart rate.

<p>Aerobic exercise improves circulation, which results in lowered blood pressure and heart rate, stewart says. These gases are exchanged with the atmosphere when you breathe. Both your pulse and breathing rate increase with exercise, maintaining a ratio of approximately 1 breath for every 4. These include decreased resting heart rate, improved ability to draw in deeper breaths, reduced resting blood pressure, increased calories burned to aid weight loss and reduced risk of heart disease.</p>
