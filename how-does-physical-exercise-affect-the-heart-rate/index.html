The adaptability of the heart can be observed during exercise, when the metabolic activity of skeletal muscle tissue increases. The next question is, where do the oxygen that the muscle need comes from? Exercise also stimulates the production of new blood vessels. But that protection likely depends on reaching a certain intensity of exercise, she adds.

<p>The purpose of this lab was to determine which level of exercise would have the greatest impact on affected pulse and blood. Exercise greatly lowers the likelihood of individuals contracting forms of heart disease across the board. This means the heart beats fewer times per minute than it would in a nonathlete. The next question is, where do the oxygen that the muscle need comes from?</p>

Kaiser permanente explains that when your heart gets stronger, it pushes out more blood with every beat — which means it doesn't have to work as hard to circulate adequate oxygen and nutrients when you exercise.

<p>The blood volume and blood flow returning to your heart increases. Thats likely because exercise strengthens the heart muscle. As we make more blood vessels, there are more places for blood to flow, which results in more efficient circulation. When you perform cardiovascular exercises, the entire blood flow becomes directed towards the working muscles, away from the regions that aren’t working much (like your digestive tract or arms).

To test how much aerobic exercise raises the heat beat of a people, a person will take there resting heart rate, this is the heart rate of a person before doing any form of strenuous activity, for 1 minute using a stop watch, to make sure it is accurate.
