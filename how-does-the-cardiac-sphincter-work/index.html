<p>Four main sphincter muscles along the alimentary canal aid in digestion: Sphincters are circular muscles that serve as valves to open and close certain parts of the body. The esophageal sphincters are bands of muscles at the top and bottom of the esophagus — the muscular tube that passes food and drink from the mouth to the stomach. The pyloric sphincter is a small piece of smooth visceral muscle that acts as a valve and regulates the flow of partially digested food from the stomach to the duodenum.
