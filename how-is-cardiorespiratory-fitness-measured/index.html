What is Cardiovascular Fitness? Medikoe From medikoe.com
The importance of cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) is well established. It is well accepted that the gold standard indirect method of measuring vo 2 max is by using a gas analyses system. Your cardiorespiratory fitness isn’t just about your ability to go run further or faster, or to bike up a steep hill without needing to get off and walk. The best method to measure cardiorespiratory fitness is by measuring vo2max, which is a calculation of how efficiently your body can transport and uitlize oxygen.
