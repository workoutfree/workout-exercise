But if your goal is to see big increases in your strength training or overall endurance, you'll be disappointed.

If you are planning on doing cardio for conditioning, it would benefit you to do your cardio before weight training. However, if your goal is to run your first marathon, it doesnât quite make sense to prioritize weight training. Whether 2 hours is enough rest depends on the fitness and genetics of the individual.</p>
