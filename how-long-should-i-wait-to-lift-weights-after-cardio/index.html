Most bodybuilders exercise 10 to 15 minutes of cardio before their weight training workout. Slowly introducing walking, weight training, and rib and chest expansion exercises can be helpful in your recovery. How long should I wait to call after a first date? Muscle &amp; Fitness.</p>

But if your goal is to see big increases in your strength training or overall endurance, you'll be disappointed.
