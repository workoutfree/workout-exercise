Training zones are designed to maximise physiological adaptations to your swim, bike and run efforts, and reduce the chances of injury. The large majority of your training should be done in the low end of your steady zone. Incorporating more days focused on longer zone 3 and 4 efforts are key to building muscle endurance and power as you train into your late base building phases ( a.
