Should You Do Cardio Before Or After Weight Training From mensxp.com
Lifting weights can help promote weight loss. If your goal is to get stronger and build or maintain your muscle mass, then you’ll want to avoid doing your cardio before you lift weights as it can decrease performance and increase your risk of injury. If you only have one hour a day to hit the gym and exercise, this seems pretty reasonable. For example, strength training (anaerobic exercises) can be done on mondays, wednesdays, and fridays and cardio exercises (aerobic) can be done on tuesdays, thursdays, and saturdays.
