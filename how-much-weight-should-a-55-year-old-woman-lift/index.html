<p>How much weight can the average woman lift? We do not recommend weight training more than 5 times a week as this can overexert your body and make an injury more likely. Joseph signorile, phd, a professor in the department of kinesiology and sports sciences also from the university of miami, recommends starting around 30 percent of the maximum weight you can lift and working up to about 75 to 85 percent.while there are many ways to determine that maximum weight, mccarthy says a good rule of thumb is if you can't.
