Cardiorespiratory Endurance Definition &amp; Examples Openfit From openfit.com
Cardiorespiratory fitness is basically how aerobically fit, and how efficient your circulatory system delivers. Your doctor can measure cardiorespiratory fitness through what&#39;s called your maximal oxygen consumption (vo2 max) or from readings taken while you do an aerobic workout. Do anything that gets your heart rate up. People of all ages need to be physically active for at least 30 minutes a day to maintain good health, but cardiorespiratory fitness is necessary for older adults.
