What Happens to Your Body When You Introduce Cardio Exercise From warnerfamilypractice.net
Cardiovascular fitness or endurance is a measure of how well your body takes in oxygen and delivers it to your muscles and organs when you exercise. Additionally, it can reduce your risk of diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.
