<p>There are many tests that can be done to evaluate cardiorespiratory fitness (the efficiency of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems during exercise). This of course is assuming that the low heart rate is not because of some kind of heart illness. Measurement of vo2 max through indirect calorimetry is expensive and requires trained personnel. Updates to the algorithm used to estimate vo2 max in watchos 7 extend estimates to lower ranges of cardio fitness (14 to 60 ml/kg/min) for users with apple watch series 3 or later.
