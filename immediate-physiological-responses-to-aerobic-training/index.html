The increased demand of oxygen and nutrients required during exercise dictates the bodies physiological changes. At the cessation of exercise there will be a quick decline in hr. The main goal of this study was to investigate the acute metabolic and cardiorespiratory response to long and short hiie compared to continuous exercise (ce) as well as its regulation and predictability. When an individual exercises, various physiological changes occur within their body to ensure that adequate amounts of oxygen and nutrients are being provided to the working muscles.
