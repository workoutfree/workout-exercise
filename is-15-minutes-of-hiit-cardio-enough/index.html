<meta name="description" content="20 Min Is 15 Minutes Of Hiit Cardio Enough For Weight Loss, I&#39;ve read studies where the subjects did no cardio, ate sufficient protein and had high fat loss while losing minimal lean body mass. Repeat for eight rounds total.
20 minutes HIIT has sorted me right out. Incline at 15 20 seconds From pinterest.com
Hiit workouts, which usually lasts just four to 15 minutes, can also give you more bang for your buck in terms of calorie burn. Well if you do hiit 15min is plenty or possibly more than enough. I am not sure if its hiit since i sprint at 90 percent instead of going 100 percent. Workouts such as les mills grit™ are carefully crafted so that your heart rate reaches specific training zones for a certain proportion of the workout, which means your heart rate is likely to reach 90 percent maximum for a period of 15 minutes.
