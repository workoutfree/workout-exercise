Comparing aerobic interval training and aerobic continuous training in patients with coronary artery disease or chronic heart failure. To cool down after a run, walk briskly for five to 10 minutes. Continuous training is a kind of exercise in which the intensity is maintained throughout and there are no break intervals. Aerobic training must be specific to the athlete&#39;s sport;

<p>As the supply becomes inadequate, for whatever reason, the body’s anaerobic system is gradually brought on line to make up the deficit. Aerobic development is achieved by elevating the heart rate and maintaining this level for an extended time. Aerobic training should be done at least 3 times a week, at an intensity between 70% and 80% of their maximum heart rate, and normally goes for 30+min in duration. This is why interval training is more effective than continuous training for increasing strength and muscle mass.</p>

<p>You generally continue your workout session for five minutes or so, but at a slower pace and reduced intensity. To cool down after swimming, swim laps leisurely for five to 10. The continuous or uniform method requires athletes to train for an extended period of time (a minimum of 20 minutes) without stopping for rest breaks. Objective we aimed to investigate (1) the effects of aerobic interval training (ait) and aerobic continuous training (act) on (sub)maximal exercise measures and its determinants including endothelial function, muscle strength and cardiac autonomic function, and (2) the relationship between exercise capacity and these determinants.

<p>Comparing aerobic interval training and aerobic continuous training in patients with coronary artery disease or chronic heart failure. Continuous aerobic training is defined as exercise (e.g., running, cycling, swimming, etc.) lasting greater than 20 minutes and held at steady intensity during the entire bout. Continuous training is a form of exercise that is performed at a 'continuous' intensity throughout and doesn’t involve any rest periods. The continuous or uniform method requires athletes to train for an extended period of time (a minimum of 20 minutes) without stopping for rest breaks. Interval Training Workouts Build Speed and Endurance.</p>

Objective we aimed to investigate (1) the effects of aerobic interval training (ait) and aerobic continuous training (act) on (sub)maximal exercise measures and its determinants including endothelial function, muscle strength and cardiac autonomic function, and (2) the relationship between exercise capacity and these determinants. This typically involves any exercise that lasts longer than two minutes in duration.

<p>Continuous training is a kind of exercise in which the intensity is maintained throughout and there are no break intervals. Aerobic exercises such as running, biking, swimming, and rowing are common in continuous training. Aerobic development is achieved by elevating the heart rate and maintaining this level for an extended time. The primary outcome was change in peak oxygen uptake.
