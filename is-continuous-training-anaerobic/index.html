Possible Consequences of Continuous Highintensity Training OPS From opstudiohk.com
The anaerobic threshold is the lowest intensity of exercise at which the production of lactate exceeds the body’s ability to utilize lactate as fuel in aerobic metabolism. Anaerobic interval training consists of high intensity movements for short periods concluding with a period of rest. Aerobic, means with oxygen, therefore while you’re training in an aerobic state, your body has a sufficient amount of oxygen to provide the energy which is necessary to sustain an exercise for a prolonged period of time, without tapping into other energy. This is why interval training is more effective than continuous training for increasing strength and muscle mass.

Continuous training is when an athlete exercises steadily, and interval training is characterized by repetitions of work with a recovery period following each repetition. The greater the intensity of exercise above the anaerobic threshold, the greater the rise.

<p>The difference between aerobic and anaerobic training is the fuel source. Aerobic exercises typically help build endurance and have a greater affect on cardiovascular health. That being said, circuit training is also tailored to focus exclusively on aerobic or anaerobic exercises depending on your fitness.

<p>Anaerobic interval training consists of high intensity movements for short periods concluding with a period of rest. In the gym, these types of training. Both interval and continuous training are necessary in order to maximize the endurance athlete's potential for competition. Specifically, it was reported that the continuous training group showed changes in cardiorespiratory variables before and after the lactate.

<h3 id="generally-these-activities-are-of-short-length-with-high-intensity">Generally, These Activities Are Of Short Length With High Intensity.</h3><p>The anaerobic threshold is the lowest intensity of exercise at which the production of lactate exceeds the body’s ability to utilize lactate as fuel in aerobic metabolism. Continuous training is when an athlete exercises steadily, and interval training is characterized by repetitions of work with a recovery period following each repetition. Aerobic plus anaerobic training produces greater lipid metabolism without significant changes to glucose924&lt;/sup&gt; was higher in during 10 minutes of continuous exercise but the total accumulated change in middle cerebral artery blood velocity was higher with the interval.
