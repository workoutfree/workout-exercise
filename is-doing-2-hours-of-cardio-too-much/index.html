The lower it is, the better. A lot of people think that if you starve yourself and do two or three hours of cardio each day, the fat is just going to melt off. You can get better results in less time by doing some resistance training 4 days a week for about 30 minutes a day, and maybe doing cardio 5 days a week, for 1/2 hour in the morning before breakfast. Everyone should aim to log at least 150 minutes (2.5 hours) of cardio every week.
