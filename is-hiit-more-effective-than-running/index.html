The Best HIIT Apps of 2017 From healthline.com
Hiit running was more effective than hiit cycling for reducing total body fat, while lower intensities (below 90 percent maximum heart rate) produced better results in terms of abdominal and visceral fat loss. Running, on the other hand, is better than swimming if you want to prevent bone loss, all while toning your lower body, and burning calories. The authors found that hiit programs incorporating running were more likely to show fat mass losses than with cycling. Hiit can be used while running, cycling, rowing and so on.
