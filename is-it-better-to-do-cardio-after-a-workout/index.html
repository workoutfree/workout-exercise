Is It Better to Do Cardio Before or After Weight Training? Athletes From athletessociety.com.au

I&#39;ve learned that lifting before cardio is much better for fat loss and workout energy efficiency. If your cardio workouts typically last longer than 30 minutes and/or higher intensity, they can hurt muscle and strength gains if performed immediately before or after weight training. While weight training first will ensure your glycogen (sugars stored for muscle contraction) reserves are full, if your ultimate goal is to get fit and reduce fat, then you can do a little weight training after a cardio workout.
