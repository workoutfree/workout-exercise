What are Peloton lowimpact rides and why are they worth your time From ouiinfrance.com
If you’re attempting a peloton 80 day challenge, fill up a lot of your rides with low impact or, better yet, recovery rides. The low impact class is good for people who are new to cycling and want an easy way to start riding without feeling too much pain in. Low impact rides typically do not contain arms sections; All peloton low impact rides are in the saddle, which is a good option for people recovering from the knee or lower back injury, as well as for heavier people who struggle to stand while riding the bike.
