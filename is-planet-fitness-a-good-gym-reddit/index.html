<p>In reality, these expenses have the potential to keep clients away from the gym. At the end of the day, if you have a problem with planet fitness then just take your money elsewhere…although it may be hard to find a gym membership for less than $10 a month. The membership cost for the classic membership is just $10 per month. Unless you're a beginner, a planet fitness membership isn't worth it.</p>

<p>The biggest difference between gold’s gym and planet fitness is definitely the equipment selection and culture. If you’re looking for more amenities or plan to do any serious weight lifting, i wouldn’t recommend. Even its black card membership is cheaper than its competitors’ premium membership by $23+ a year.
