<p>In reality, these expenses have the potential to keep clients away from the gym. At the end of the day, if you have a problem with planet fitness then just take your money elsewhereâ¦although it may be hard to find a gym membership for less than $10 a month. The membership cost for the classic membership is just $10 per month. Unless you're a beginner, a planet fitness membership isn't worth it.</p>

<p>The biggest difference between goldâs gym and planet fitness is definitely the equipment selection and culture. If youâre looking for more amenities or plan to do any serious weight lifting, i wouldnât recommend.

<p>But now, planet fitness is perfect for me. But to be clear, this is a gym, not a planet fitness. At $10 a month for classic membership and $22.99 a month for a black card membership, planet fitness beats out 15 other gyms for the title of cheapest chain gym ever.
