<p>And so, we have training levels….or power zones. Vo2 max efforts aim to increase your power during short, intense efforts and to expand your aerobic capacity, i.e. Output/power is essentially a combination of cadence and resistance and thus quantifies the rider’s rate of work on the bike. Zones are ranges of output (a mix of cadence and resistance) and each zone is customized to your fitness level. Power Training Zones Quantified Rowing.</p>
