Resistance training is a form of physical activity that is designed to improve muscular fitness by exercising a muscle or a muscle group against external resistance. When aerobic exercise precedes strength training, any muscle strength impairments are limited to the muscle groups used in the prior aerobic training. Combined aerobic and resistance training is the preferred. Recent studies have begun using a combination of aerobic and resistance exercise to determine if additive benefits exist in which an ~3 mmhg reduction in blood pressure has been observed.

<p>The effects of aerobic exercise and resistance exercise on endothelial cells may not be adequately elucidated in a study of older female diabetes patients, especially through a short 12 week study. In addition to that, the resistance training group had greater reductions in hba1c compared with the aerobic group (&lt;0.006).

<p>Aerobic exercise is helpful to improve circulation and to burn calories and, if done long enough, to also help burn fat stores. These can be performed one or more days per week, depending on the training season (1). Aerobic training has more beneficial effects on aerobic power (peak oxygen consumption) and cardiac structure and function than resistance exercise training, while the latter is more effective for increasing muscle strength and endurance and promoting favorable arterial remodeling.

The effects of aerobic exercise and resistance exercise on endothelial cells may not be adequately elucidated in a study of older female diabetes patients, especially through a short 12 week study. For instance, when cycle ergometry (a lower body cardiovascular modality) was performed first in the concurrent sequence, it was shown to noticeably impair the lower body resistance training. When aerobic exercise precedes strength training, any muscle strength impairments are limited to the muscle groups used in the prior aerobic training.
