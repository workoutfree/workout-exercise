In this istqb agile tester tutorial, we will learn about exploratory testing in software testing and the process and techniques to perform exploratory testing. Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence testing can show that defects. The istqb testing glossary has incorporated many of these suggested updates.

<p>Unit tests are basically written and executed by software developers to make sure that code meets its design and requirements and behaves as expected. The precise definition of complete testing (a synonym for exhaustive testing) is: A unit is the smallest testable part of the software.
