<p>When the muscle cells contract, force is created as the muscles pull against the skeleton. Muscular endurance is the ability of a muscle to exert force against resistance over time. Given the proper physical definitions and formulations involved in muscular power measurement, it is concluded that although strength (force output) and power (work/time) are quantitatively related, they remain separate physical parameters that can be measured in all dynamic muscular contractions, whether fast or slow. All our body activities like lifting, walking, running, bending are because of muscular force. Muscular Force (Easy Definition) + Examples in Daily Life.</p>
