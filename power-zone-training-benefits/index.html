It&#39;s not hard to replicate the basic structure of the class within a another ride with better music. The benefits for the athlete who integrates them into their daily training are plenty. The intensities can be set based on heart rate, power, or perceived exertion, which is how intense the exercise feels. Power zone training is a method of intentional training based on the metric of output or power (measured in watts).
