<meta name="description" content="List Of Resistance Training For Fat Loss Study For Diet, Ten weeks of resistance training may increase lean weight by 1.4 kg, increase resting metabolic rate by 7%, and reduce fat weight by 1.8 kg. A recent study has shown clear evidence for the importance of resistance training in causing significant weight loss.
6 Benefits Of Resistance Training In Weight Loss From healthyy.net
Remember, i started this blog with a study that showed how resistance training sets the cells up for burning body fat. The purpose of this study was to determine what effect aerobic and resistance exercise training has on gain of visceral fat during the year following weight loss. The effect of resistance training in healthy adults on body fat percentage, fat mass and visceral fat: Background resistance training is the gold standard exercise mode for accrual of lean muscle mass, but the isolated effect of resistance training on body fat is unknown.
