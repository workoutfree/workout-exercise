Heart patients benefit from resistance training HCM research From healthclubmanagement.co.uk
Wipawee laksanakorn pm＆r ,golden jubilee medical center mahidol university. It amazes me that some heart attack patients i’ve worked with had quite large heart attacks but really had no conceptual understanding of exactly what a heart attack is. The utility, safety and physiological adaptations of resistance exercise training in patients with chronic heart failure (chf) are reviewed and recommendations based on current research are presented. Several studies have shown significant reductions in resting blood pressure after two or more months of regular resistance training.
