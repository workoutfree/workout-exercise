Treadmill Exercise or Resistance Training in Patients With Peripheral From jamanetwork.com
The effect of shortterm resistance training on people with symptomatic peripheral artery disease. • peripheral arterial disease (pad) significantly affects quality of life, particularly when doing activities such as walking and climbing stairs. The results of this study demonstrate that 8 weeks of resistance or endurance exercise training reduces peripheral arterial stiffness and central bps. Resistance training is usually prescribed in addition to walking or other forms of aerobic exercise, although it should be noted that the effects of this combined approach have not been systematically examined in pad.
