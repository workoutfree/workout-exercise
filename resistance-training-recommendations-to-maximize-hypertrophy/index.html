<p>This umbrella review aimed to analyze the different variables of resistance training and their effect on hypertrophy, and to provide practical recommendations for the prescription of resistance training programs to maximize hypertrophy responses. Significant hypertrophy can be achieved when training a muscle group as infrequently as once per week in lower to moderate volume protocols; For some athletes, muscular bulk and, conceivably, the accompanying increase in strength/power, are desirable attributes for optimal. The manipulation of resistance training (rt) variables is widely considered an essential strategy to maximize muscular adaptations.</p>
