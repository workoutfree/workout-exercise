There is a consensus about certain modes of exercise to be applied (e.g., aerobic, respiratory, and resistance exercise) or not applied (e.g., prolonged anaerobic exercise; 1 heart failure affects several organs and tissues including skeletal muscles. Patients with chf have a poor clinical status and impaired exercise capacity due to both cardiac limitations and peripheral maladaptations of the. Both aerobic and resistance training improve exercise capacity and may partially reverse some of the cardiac, vascular, and skeletal muscle abnormalities in individuals with chf.
