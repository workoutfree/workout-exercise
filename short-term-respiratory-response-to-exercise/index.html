QMHS PE on Twitter &#34;GCSE PE revision for the short &amp; long term effects From twitter.com
Long and short term effects of exercise during exercise the body systems respond immediately to provide energy for the muscles to work. It is important to understand the changes that happen to the body as a result of physical activity. Start studying respiratory system response to exercise: Here are the 3 most important effects of training on the respiratory system.

The respiratory system provides oxygen to be transported through the blood to the exercising muscles as well as eliminating carbon dioxide. Basic Exercise physiology.</p>

During exercise, the gas exchange requirements of the lung increase due to an increased oxygen consumption and increased carbon dioxide production.
