<p>Maximum heart rate is calculated based on a person’s age. It means that your heart is in better condition and doesn’t have to work as hard to maintain a steady beat. At a 50 percent exertion level, your target would be 50 percent of that maximum, or 85 beats per minute. Target heart rate is typically expressed as a percentage of a person’s maximum safe heart rate, usually between 50 and 85 percent of that number. High Heart Rate BikeRadar Forum.</p>
