Heart Rhythm By Hiren Kevadiya From drhirenkevadiya.com
Ep testing is used predominantly in patients with suspected or. If you have an arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm), cardiologists can use an electrophysiologic study (eps) to find out what part of the heart is causing this change in rhythm and what medicines will work best to bring that rhythm back to normal. The test is performed by inserting catheters and then wire electrodes, which measure electrical activity, through blood vessels that enter the heart. Changes in the axis of the ecg can indicate right ventricular hypertrophy or a conduction block.

<p>In patients with syncope or episodes of palpitations and heart disease, an electrophysiology study (eps) may be of value by means of potential induction of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias.[1,2] programmed ventricular stimulation may be useful in the context of risk stratification of ischaemic patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef). Drawing of the ecg, with labels of intervals. This helps keep blood flowing the way it should. Invasive electrophysiological (ep) testing involves recording a por­tion of cardiac electrical activity and programmed cardiac elec­trical stimulation via multipolar catheter electrodes positioned percutaneously strategically at various locations within the cardiac chambers.
