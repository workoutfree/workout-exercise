<p>In a vascular bundle, the xylem transports water and minerals from roots to leaves and phloem transports food from leaves to all parts of the plant. Blood vessels play a significant role in the circulatory system [ 1 ]. It is a strand of the particular vascular tissue of higher plants consisting mostly of xylem and phloem.

<p>The transport itself happens in vascular tissue, which exists in two forms: Water and ions are transported mainly by xylem, and dissolved organic solutes mainly by the phloem. These strands during the course of time distinguish. These vascular tissues are located very close to each other in the plant and form a bundle known as vascular bundle.

<p>The main function of blood vessels is transporting blood from the heart to the rest of the tissues and organs throughout the body and then bringing it back to the heart. In open vascular bundles a layer of cambium will be present between the xylem and phloem and thus they shows secondary growth.
