<p>The vascular bundles are scattered in the ground tissue. In these types of vascular bundles, xylem and phloem tissues occur in separate groups on alternate radial positions. The transport itself happens in the stem, which exists in two forms: The xylem and phloem tissues are present on the same radius and just opposed to each other in conjoint vascuÂ­lar bundles.</p>

<p>It is a strand of the particular vascular tissue of higher plants consisting mostly of xylem and phloem. Members of the vascular bundles are derived from the procambium of the apical. The key difference between collateral and bicollateral vascular bundles is that collateral vascular bundle has a strand of phloem and xylem situated on the same radius while bicollateral vascular bundle has two phloem strands situated on the peripheral and inner side of xylem. But, the vascular tissue is composed of xylem and phloem. Plants for moodle.</p>
