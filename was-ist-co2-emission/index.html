Rapid growth in carbon dioxide emissions breaks in 2015 CSIRO From csiro.au
Global fossil co2 emissions were 35,753,305,000 tons in. Carbon dioxide emissions associated with energy and industrial production can come from a range of fuel types. Carbon emissions, measured in co2e, is a unit that measures the carbon dioxide equivalent that may be released from the chosen human activity. About 44% of this is from coal, about 34% from oil and about 21%.
