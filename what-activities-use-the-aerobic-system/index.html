aerobic is defined as relating to, involving, or requiring oxygen, and refers to the use of oxygen to meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism adequately. A long duration energy system using carbohydrates, fats and protein for energy sources, used for long distance sport activities and can only be active when oxygen is there, therefore it takes a few minutes to start.an example of a sport activities that use the aerobic system are marathon, 3000m running etc. The adapted muscles have an easier time transporting and consuming oxygen molecules, providing the exerciser with improved endurance. The body uses carbohydrates and fats while producing energy using this method.

The majority of the energy needs of a football game are aerobic in nature. However, when the intensity increases and the demands on the body change, the body must use other methods. Finally, the body can utilize the aerobic system, which is the most complex of the three systems and utilizes oxygen.</p>
<h3 id="it-is-the-presence-of-oxygen-which-allows-this-energy-system-to-use">It Is The Presence Of Oxygen, Which Allows This Energy System To Use</h3><p>Neither system provides sustainable energy for very long. The aerobic system is the main source of energy at rest. If you exercise at a pace higher than a jog or run, you are sprinting, entering your anaerobic heart rate, and won’t able to continue very long. If you go below your aerobic heart rate, you would be walking.</p>
