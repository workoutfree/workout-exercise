Regulation of cardiac output includes autonomic nervous system, endocrine and paracrine signaling. Low cardiac output will reduce energy levels. It is about 50 ml; Decreased cardiac output is a reduction in the heart’s ability to generate enough cardiac output.

Regardless of aetiology, the clinical effects of the resulting shock, namely inadequate organ perfusion, are constant, and result in organ dysfunction. Low Cardiac output The Clinical Advisor.</p>
