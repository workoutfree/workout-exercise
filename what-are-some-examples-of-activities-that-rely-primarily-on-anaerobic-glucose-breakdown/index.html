During the lifting of weights the muscles operate at maximum capacity, fulfilling the designated task during a short interval of time, because one is not going to the breathing to renew the energies. Examples of anaerobic exercises include tempo squats, lateral squats, squat to inchworm, fast feet, burpees, elevated push ups, saw planks, side plank walks, sprints, plank jacks to jumping jacks, burpee break dancer, and the speed squat thruster. Glucose is then broken down by a series of enzymes.</p>
