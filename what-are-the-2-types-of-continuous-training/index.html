<p>Continuous training is when an athlete trains in a continuous aerobic manner, while interval training is defined as a series of work repetitions separated by a recovery period. The reason for this is that there are two fundamentally different types of training and learning. Continuous training is a form of exercise that is performed at a 'continuous' intensity throughout and doesn’t involve any rest periods. Continuous training is when you exercise the body at a moderate rate keeping the pulse at a constant level without periods of rest. 1.1.4 methods of training ktu.</p>
