<p>It is always important that you monitor your emotions, especially if you have developed heart complications in the past. Thats likely because exercise strengthens the heart muscle. This leads to an increased heart rate and increased circulation, which gets oxygenated blood to your muscles quicker. The constant variables in my experiment are;1.</p>

<p>Use the stethoscopes and timers to record how many heartbeats you can hear in 30 seconds. Physically fit people can deliver a greater volume of blood in a single. High intensity activities like sprinting, swimming and playing football involve several muscle groups working at a high rate, which elevates your heart rate. This effect is due to increased activity in your vagus nerve, which acts to slow down the heart at rest. <em>Swimming</em> Swimming is a healthy activity that keeps your heart rate up.</p>

<p>I think that the heart rate will increase more dramatically when you exercise an area that contains bigger muscles than an area that contains smaller muscles. Your heart rate will definitely increase as your activity level rises, but there is a healthy range for your heart rate, and anything outside of that may be an indicator of a heart condition. Your muscles need more oxygen at this level of activity, and your heart compensates by pumping more blood to transport this extra oxygen provided by your lungs. Heart rate is the measure of how many times a person’s heart beats in a certain amount of time. Magic of Heart Rate Exercising and cardiovascular system Visual.ly.</p>

<p>The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit of time). More forceful heart contractions with each heartbeat, which leads to. Roughly 65% of the calories you burn are fat. Sweating draws water from the blood and, over time, leaves less blood flowing through your heart and to your muscles, reducing oxygen supply to the muscles.
