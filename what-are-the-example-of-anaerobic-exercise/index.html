Anaerobic v Aerobic Exercises &amp; Benefits The Chief Life From thechieflife.com
Anaerobic literally means “without air,” so anaerobic exercise is an intense exercise that requires the body to use other sources of energy besides oxygen to fuel the muscles. This enhances muscle strength and endurance, generating hypertrophy. Over that period of time, the body will source energy from glycogen. This can be contrasted with anaerobic exercise such as weight lifting that uses massive amounts of oxygen in a short time such that it can&#39;t be sustained for long.
