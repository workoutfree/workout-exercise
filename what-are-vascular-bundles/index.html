In open vascular bundles a layer of cambium will be present between the xylem and phloem and thus they shows secondary growth. The primary components of vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem. In a vascular bundle, the xylem transports water and minerals from roots to leaves and phloem transports food from leaves to all parts of the plant.

Sometimes vascular bundles are also situated in the cortex, pith, and. Xylem transports water and nutrients, phloem transports organic molecules, and cambium is involved in plant growth. The plant tissues transport water and nutrients that are pumped through the plant's whole structure, often against gravity. The vascular bundle of bamboo (Phyllostachys bambusoides) Download.</p>

<p>Vascular bundles are present in all plant organs, mainly in stem (including rhizomes or underground stems), leaves and roots (including aerial). These vascular tissues are located very close to each other in the plant and form a bundle known as vascular bundle. Collaterall vascular bundles may be closed or open, but, bicollateral vascular bundles are always open. Xylem transports water for the plant, while phloem transports food materials.
