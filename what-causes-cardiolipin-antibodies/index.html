<meta name="description" content="Simple What Causes Cardiolipin Antibodies References, Cardiolipin antibodies (also known as anticardiolipin antibodies) are associated with a number of health conditions, some of which include [ 5 ]: Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of blood fat that is important for blood clotting.
Antiphospholipid syndrome From yourdiseaseinfo.blogspot.com
When antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can form. There are evidences that in patients with high titer anti cardiolipin antibodies, pregnancy loss was prevented in more than 70% of cases. As there are four distinct alkyl chains in cardiolipin, the potential for complexity of this molecule species is enormous. Cardiolipin (cl) is a kind of diphosphatidylglycerol lipid.
