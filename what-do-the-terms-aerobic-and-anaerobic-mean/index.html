<p>So, if you sprint 100 meter as fast as you can, practically all the energy. If there is not enough oxygen present for aerobic respiration, then some organisms will resort to using anaerobic respiration or other anaerobic processes such as fermentation. Anaerobic is defined as being able to exist without, or not requiring air or oxygen. The anaerobic system delivers energy significantly faster, and will therefore deliver a greater part of the energy when the intensity is higher.
