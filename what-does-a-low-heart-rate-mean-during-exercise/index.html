When heart rate in adults exceeds 100 beats per minute at rest, then the condition is called tachycardia which has a pathological reason behind. The more you exercise, the easier it is to reach your target heart rate, which is up to 90% of your maximum heart rate. Heart rate can vary during a heart attack. It’s important to do quality sessions really well, and make sure everything else is either.

<p>The best heart rate zone for aerobic exercise is between 50 percent and 75 percent of your maximum heart rate. The heart rate can rise during exercise, running, high fever, flu, excitement, consumption of nicotine or caffeine, surgical operations, and treatment procedures. However, a 2010 report from the women's health initiative (whi) indicated that a resting heart rate at the low end of that spectrum may. When you are at rest, your heart is pumping the lowest amount of blood to supply the oxygen your body's needs.</p>
