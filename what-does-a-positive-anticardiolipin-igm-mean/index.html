The sexual dimorphism of anticardiolipin autoantibodies in acute Q From clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com
The anti cardiolipin igm antibody test enables you to diagnose inappropriate blood clot, analyze the cause for regular miscarriages, and analyze any autoimmune diseases. A negative anticardiolipin igg or igm result indicates that this type of antibody was not present or was present in too small a quantity in the blood sample being tested. The levels of these antibodies are often high in people with abnormal blood clotting, autoimmune diseases like lupus, or repeated miscarriages. Phospholipid (cardiolipin) antibodies must be detected on 2 or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart to fulfill the laboratory diagnostic criteria for aps.

<p>But in simple terms, an ana is an antibody. Moderate to high levels of cardiolipin antibodies that persist when tested again 12 weeks later indicate the likely continued presence of that specific antibody, which may be associated with an increased risk of excessive clotting or recurrent miscarriages. Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them emerging, temporarily due to an infection or drug, or asymptomatically as a person ages. The presence of serum anticardiolipin (acl) antibody without clinical symptoms does not support a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). Antiphospholipid Antibodies Circulation.</p>
