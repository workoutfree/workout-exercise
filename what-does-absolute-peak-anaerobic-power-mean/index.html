<p>Having a high or low fi does not directly indicate an athlete's ability, but if there are 2 equally powerful athletes and 1 has a lower fi, then, physiologically speaking, that athlete will probably be the better athlete. This study aimed to analyze some methods for maximal anaerobic power training and demonstrate their importance for professional soccer. The maximal anaerobic power is a trainable variable that is extremely important for a soccer player and can be trained in different ways. This research is a literature review.</p>

<p>In exercise physiology, the difference between absolute and relative expressions of anaerobic power is that absolute mean power is calculated using the constant rate of falling bodies while relative mean power is calculated using a person's body weight to be able to compare power produced by that individual to their own body. Several tests are being conducted under the wingate anaerobic test, we are the muscular speed and strength is being measured. The wingate anaerobic test is used to determine an athlete’s peak anaerobic power and anaerobic capacity. Then multiply by 100 to get the percentage decline.
