<p>Adam means ruddy or rosy because dam means blood. What does it mean that jesus is the “faithful witness” in revelation? We should realize bible names like adam can have multiple meanings (key 1) and we have to be careful which one we use. There is one other connection between adam.</p>

<p>However, etymologically they are connected but not in the way people think. Adam means ruddy or rosy because dam means blood. But that root that covers the action of producing is also the same as the root that covers redness. And there is only one other even more basic word that all of these words must have come from, which also explains why they all basically mean red but are also related to the ruddiness or rosy color of a man: &quot;Adam&quot; in ancient Hebrew!
