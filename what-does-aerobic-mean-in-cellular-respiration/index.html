What is the definition of aerobic respiration? Quora From quora.com
It eliminates carbon dioxide and water as waste products. This type of respiration is common in most plants and animals, including humans, birds and other mammals. Aerobic respiration is the cellular respiration process that occurs in the presence of oxygen. Each process produces different amounts of energy and has different benefits and drawbacks.

<p>This series of biochemical reactions is also called a âmetabolic pathway.â. It is a process when glucose is broken down in the absence of oxygen. In this process, a food molecule breaks down. However, while aerobic respiration produces atp far more quickly and effectively than anaerobic respiration, human beings experience both.</p>

<p>We need it for life because, in our soma cells, it liberates the chemical energy we use for our life function. Therefore, aerobic respiration is the process of cellular respiration that uses oxygen to produce energy from food. Cellular respiration is defined as the conversion of fuel into energy and nutrients within the mitochondria and cytosol of cells. Organisms such as prokaryotes and eukaryotes use respiration mechanisms for the breakdown of food that may require environmental oxygen. Spice of Lyfe Chemical Equation Of Respiration In Humans.</p>

<h3 id="each-process-produces-different-amounts-of-energy-and-has-different-benefits-and-drawbacks">Each Process Produces Different Amounts Of Energy And Has Different Benefits And Drawbacks.</h3><p>This type of respiration is common in most plants and animals, including humans, birds and other mammals. As its name suggested, aerobic respiration is cells breaking down sugar into energy and other waste with the presence of oxygen, or also known as what you are usually referring to when talking about cellular respiration. Aerobic respiration provides energy to fuel all cellular processes. Carbohydrates, proteins, and fat are first converted into glucose and then used in the cellular respiration.</p>
<h3 id="it-eliminates-carbon-dioxide-and-water-as-waste-products">It Eliminates Carbon Dioxide And Water As Waste Products.</h3><p>Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are processes that seem to directly oppose each other. While cellular respiration (aerobic) requires oxygen to create energy and leaves co2 as a byproduct, photosynthesis uses co2 to create energy and leaves oxygen as a byproduct. Aerobic respiration is important because it is the primary way that your cells produce energy. Here glucose molecule is completely oxidized into energy (atp), carbon dioxide, and water.</p>

However, while aerobic respiration produces atp far more quickly and effectively than anaerobic respiration, human beings experience both. Aerobic respiration takes place in the presence of oxygen, while anaerobic respiration does not require oxygen. Aerobic respiration breaks down glucose and combines the broken down products with oxygen, making water and carbon dioxide.</p>
<h3 id="it-is-a-process-when-glucose-is-broken-down-in-the-absence-of-oxygen">It Is A Process When Glucose Is Broken Down In The Absence Of Oxygen.</h3><p>Aerobic respiration is the cellular respiration process that occurs in the presence of oxygen. 'aero' means air, which contains oxygen, leading to the name aerobic respiration. Therefore, aerobic respiration is the process of cellular respiration that uses oxygen to produce energy from food. The process by which mitochondria use to transfer the energy in foods to atp is known as cellular respiration.</p>
