In fact it has three such systems and all are used simultaneously during all types of physical activity, though some more than others depending on what you’re doing. (anaerobic means without air.) all living things require energy, and when oxygen is used to metabolize (convert or break down) source for information on aerobic/anaerobic: Aerobic definition, (of an organism or tissue) requiring the presence of air or free oxygen for life. Increases endurance, which means you can workout longer without getting tired.
