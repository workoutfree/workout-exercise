<p>The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). When you see excessive blood clot, then the symptoms and signs may differ based on the location of the clot. Tests for igg and igm cardiolipin antibodies are frequently ordered to help determine the cause of an unexplained thrombotic episode, recurrent miscarriage, or thrombocytopenia.they may be ordered along with lupus anticoagulant testing to help investigate the cause of a prolonged ptt (activated partial thromboplastin time), especially if clinical findings suggest that the patient. An antibody is a substance in your blood that helps fight infection.</p>

<p>A negative result means only that cardiolipin antibodies are not present or not present at a detectable level in the blood at the time of the test. It is the first immunoglobulin to be produced following antigenic challenge. When antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can form. If it is very low, or other antibodies are also low (or not functioning), it may be a sign of immune deficiency that can lead to more infections.
