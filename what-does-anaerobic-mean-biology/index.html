Where Is The Energy Stored In Atp Quizlet Wasfa Blog From wasfa-hd.blogspot.com
The word “anaerobic” is defined as “not requiring oxygen” or describing something lacking in molecular oxygen. Anaerobic respiration releases less energy than aerobic respiration but it does this more quickly. Anaerobic respiration is a relatively fast re action and produces 2 atp, which is far fewer than aerobic respiration. Infections caused by anaerobic bacteria can occur almost anywhere in your body.

<p>A form of respiration in which molecular oxygen is not consumed, for example, nitrate respiration, sulfate respiration. An anaerobic culture means the test is done without letting oxygen get to the sample. Anaerobic bacteria are fastidious, difficult to isolate, and often overlooked. The fundamental difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the usage of oxygen in the process of cellular respiration.
