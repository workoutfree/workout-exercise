<p>The fundamental difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the usage of oxygen in the process of cellular respiration. In these cases, other energy sources must be used. Bacteria which grow without o2, either by metabolic necessity (obligate anaerobes) or by preference (facultative anaerobes). Anaerobic literally means “without air,” so anaerobic exercise is an intense exercise that requires the body to use other sources of energy besides oxygen to fuel the muscles.</p>
