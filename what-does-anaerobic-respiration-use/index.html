Alcohol fermentation is the formation of alcohol from sugar. During aerobic respiration, glucose is broken down in the presence of oxygen to form water and carbon dioxide. The word equation for fermentation is glucose produces ethanol and carbon dioxide. Anaerobic respiration occurs mostly in prokaryotes.

<p>Anaerobic respiration is a metabolic process that does not use oxygen. Under anaerobic conditions, the absence of oxygen, pyruvic acid can be routed by the organism into one of three pathways: The process uses a respiratory electron transport chain but does not use oxygen as the electron acceptors.
