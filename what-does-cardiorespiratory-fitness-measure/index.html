17 Best Body Measurement To Indicate Cardio Health Celeb Body Measurement From baldbarograhhp.blogspot.com
Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) reflects the body’s ability to transport oxygen during sustained physical activity. It is typically plotted from doing physical work tests using a bicycle ergometer, or treadmill, but. Good crf is not only important for your overall health and quality of life, such as your energy levels, sleep, and mood, but it also reduces the risk of heart disease. The objective measurement of cardiorespiratory fitness as a proximal outcome of total physical activity levels could be used to complement the global plan’s evaluation process.
