Certain traits will have been lost from the gene pool forever. Fitness in this evolutionary sense has three important features: A) level of overall health of the individual b) how many offspring an individual produces c) level of overall health of the population d) the size and diversity of the gene pool. If they mate, the barriers makes it impossible to fertilize the egg.

Officially, fitness is defined as the average number of children that organisms with a certain genotype or phenotype leave behind in comparison to the number of offspring left behind by other organisms in the community.

<p>What events can lead to offspring having a unique arrangement of their parents’ genes? A genotype’s fitness depends on the environment in which the organism lives. The term ” fitness ” in evolutionary biology means the ability of an organism to pass on its genetic material to its offspring. Officially, fitness is defined as the average number of children that organisms with a certain genotype or phenotype leave behind in comparison to the number of offspring left behind by other organisms in the community. TSP (large instances) evolution of the mean fitness for objectives 1.</p>
