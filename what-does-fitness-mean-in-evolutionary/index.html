PPT Robert C. Bolles and Evolutionary Psychology PowerPoint From slideserve.com
Evolutionary fitness is measured by the conribution to the gene pool into the next generation. What does “fitness” mean when speaking in terms of evolution? (5 days ago) fitness, a fundamental concept in evolutionary biology, is defined as reproductive success/number of offspring, or as adaptedness, that is, properties and capacities that make an organism more adapted to the environment. What does fitness mean in evolutionary terms?

<p>Evolutionary fitness is how well a species is able to survive and reproduce in its environment. So if brown beetles consistently leave more offspring than green beetles because of their color, you’d say that the brown beetles had a higher fitness.
