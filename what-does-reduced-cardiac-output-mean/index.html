When measuring output for a patient record, the volume of urine, drainage from tubes, vomitus, and any other measurable liquid should be recorded. It is related to the amount of blood pumped by the heart per minute. [ owt´poot ] the yield or total of anything produced by any functional system of the body. If the cardiac output is very low, this can damage organs, particularly the kidneys.
