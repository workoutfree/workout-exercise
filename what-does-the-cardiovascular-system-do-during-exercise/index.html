During exercise, the job of the cardiovascular system is to deliver blood and oxygen from the heart and lungs to your working muscles. Your blood pressure goes up as your exercise, but this effect is temporary. Since oxygen is transported through the bloodstream, the heart needs to pump more blood to supply the working muscles with oxygen. The blood flow through the cerebral vessels increases by nearly 30%.

Two of the key functions of the cardiovascular system are to: Cardiac Output Cardiac Output = Stroke Volume x Cardiac Rate.</p>

<p>The changes in cardiac function during exercise therefore occur too rapidly to be explained by activation of baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes. Since oxygen is transported through the bloodstream, the heart needs to pump more blood to supply the working muscles with oxygen. During physical exercise, more oxygen is needed for energy production. The starting point is the work of the heart muscle. Gas Exchange The Respiratory System Materials Exchange in the Body.</p>
