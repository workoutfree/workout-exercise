<p>Adaptations result from natural selection and result in evolution. Officially, fitness is defined as the average number of children that organisms with a certain genotype or phenotype leave behind in comparison to the number of offspring left behind by other organisms in the community. In evolution, fitness is about success at surviving and reproducing, not about exercise and strength. Fitness is not the fastest or lifts the most weight.

<p>Fitness is a measure of an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce, with the emphasis on the word “reproduce.”. When the reproductive rate (of a genotype or phenotype) is compared to the maximum reproductive rate (of other genotypes or phenotypes) in a particular population, it is considered a measure of biological fitness. Charles darwin outlined the mechanisms of how species change, by natural selection and sexual selection. An organism can merely reproduce and create viable offspring. Mean fitness graph of the evolutionary runs mean, 0.95 confidence.</p>
