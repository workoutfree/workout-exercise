Aerobic Cellular Respiration Definition And Steps Science Trends From sciencetrends.com
It is a process when glucose is broken down to carbon dioxide in the presence of oxygen to produce energy in the form of atp. Aerobic 1 means living, active, or respiration only in the presence of oxygen aerobic.aerobicness is the quality or state of being aerobic, and specij is an organisms ability to use oxygen as a source of aerobic energy. In this process, water and carbon dioxide are produced as end products. The process by which mitochondria use to transfer the energy in foods to atp is known as cellular respiration.
