Information and translations of biogeochemical cycle in the most comprehensive dictionary definitions resource on the web. A biogeochemical cycle involves the exchanges of chemical elements between different parts of the earth, such as the atmosphere, land, and sea, soils. Biogeochemical cycles involve both organic and inorganic substances, including water as well as elements such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and others. The biogeochemical cycles can be defined as the cyclic movement of chemical elements of biosphere between the organism and the environment.

<p>The ways in which an elementâor compound such as waterâmoves between its various living and nonliving forms and locations in the biosphere is called a biogeochemical cycle. Biogeochemical cycles involve both organic and inorganic substances, including water as well as elements such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and others. The passage of a nutrient through an ecosystem so that it eventually becomes reavailable to the primary producers. Energy flows through an ecosystem and is dissipated as heat, but chemical elements are recycled.</p>
