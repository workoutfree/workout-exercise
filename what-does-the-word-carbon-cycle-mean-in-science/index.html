In fact, most of the time you&#39;ll find the word you are looking for after typing only one or two letters. Carbon in the atmosphere is present in the form of carbon dioxide. Maintaining this carbon balance allows the planet to remain hospitable for life. The cycle by which plants through photosynthesis use atmospheric carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates, which are in turn metabolized by animals to decomposition products that return carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.

<p>What is the meaning of cycle in science? Different paths of the carbon cycle recycle the element at varying rates. The carbon cycle is vital to life on earth. Nature tends to keep carbon levels balanced, meaning that the amount of carbon naturally released from reservoirs is equal to the amount that is naturally absorbed by reservoirs.
