<p>The hydrologic cycle is the continuous circulation of water throughout earth and between earth's systems. (water cycle)this is the movement of water and its transformation between the gaseous (vapour), liquid, and solid forms. The hydrologic cycle may be the most important system for supporting our planet’s biomes. The hydrologic cycle, also known as the water cycle, is the series of processes that water goes through during its journey on, above, and below earth's surface.through.</p>

<p>Environmental scientists know that the hydrologic cycle includes various processes that change water from solid to liquid to gas form and transport it to every corner of earth’s surface (and below). The hydrologic cycle describes the circulation of water from the ocean and other watery surfaces to the atmosphere and to the land.a major source of atmospheric water vapor is evaporation from the oceans. The water cycle — technically known as the hydrological cycle — is the continuous circulation of water within the earth's hydrosphere, and is driven by solar radiation. Condensation is the change of the state of matter from the gas phase into the liquid phase, and is the reverse of vaporization. The hydrological cycle.</p>

The water, or hydrologic, cycle describes the pilgrimage of water as water molecules make their way from the earth’s surface to the atmosphere and back again, in some cases to below the surface. The water cycle is defined as a natural process of constantly recycling the water in the atmosphere. The meaning of hydrologic cycle is the sequence of conditions through which water passes from vapor in the atmosphere through precipitation upon land or water surfaces and ultimately back into the atmosphere as a result of evaporation and transpiration —called also hydrological cycle, water cycle.
