What is anaerobic respiration gcse pe? It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food. Respiration is the essential process that takes place in all of our cells to release energy from glucose. Organisms use this energy in a lot of different ways, you will need to be able to list a few:
