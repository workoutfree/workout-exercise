The Respiratory System SCIENCE IS LIFE From scienceislife4sgss.weebly.com
The cells break down the molecules of glucose and release energy, which is used to produce atp. It is the release of a relatively large amount of energy in cells by the breakdown of food substances in the presence of oxygen: Electrons are transferred to oxygen using the. Aerobic respiration is a more efficient process than anaerobic respiration because it produces more atp per molecule of glucose than anaerobic respiration.

Aerobic respiration is important because it is the primary way that your cells produce energy. Anaerobic Respiration Definition, Equation &amp; Examples Video &amp; Lesson.</p>

<p>Some kinds of bacteria are so good at anaerobic respiration that they don’t bother with oxygen at all. It is a process when glucose is broken down to carbon dioxide in the presence of oxygen to produce energy in the form of atp. Cellular respiration is of two types, i.e. If oxygen is present, the pyruvate produced in glycolysis is oxidized further in the krebs cycle, a continuation of aerobic respiration.
