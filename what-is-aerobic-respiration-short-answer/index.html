More detailed differences between the two are as follows: Give one usage of yeast. It is a colorless, odorless gas that, in the molecular form of o2, composes one fifth of the air we breathe. Aerobic respiration occurs in all living cells whereas anaerobic respiration occurs only in some bacteria, fungi, germinating seeds, fleshy fruits etc.
