Stronger breathing muscles and less chance of lung disease. The cardiovascular system also has to adapt to physical exercise, the impact of which relates to several issues related to the heart and blood vessel system. The exercise in cardiac output during exercise is the result of the increase in stroke volume and. Increase in stroke volume :stroke volume increases proportionally with exercise intensity.

Cardiovascular system is a systematic series of vessels that transport blood to the tissues from the heart &amp; back to the heart. As exercise continues, the body core temperature rises, which will also help to increase the heart rate since it increases the speed of the conduction of nerve impulse across the heart. The cardiovascular system serves five important functions (1) during exercise:</p>
