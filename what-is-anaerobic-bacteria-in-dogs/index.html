Amphibian, avian, canine, cervid, equine, exotic, feline, rodent: An anaerobe is an organism that requires an environment that is reduced in oxygen for growth and does not grow in air. Obligate anaerobic bacteria cannot survive in areas of high oxygen content or high redox potential.

<p>This report offers a consensus opinion on the diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment, and control of the primary enteropathogenic bacteria in dogs and cats, with an emphasis on clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., and escherichia coli associated with granulomatous colitis in boxers. These organisms, along with a number of other species of campylobacter, can be isolated from infected dogs that do not show signs of infection (carriers) as well as from dogs that show signs of the illness.this disease can be transmitted to humans.
