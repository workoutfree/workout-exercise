Amphibian, avian, canine, cervid, equine, exotic, feline, rodent: An anaerobe is an organism that requires an environment that is reduced in oxygen for growth and does not grow in air. Obligate anaerobic bacteria cannot survive in areas of high oxygen content or high redox potential.

These organisms, along with a number of other species of campylobacter, can be isolated from infected dogs that do not show signs of infection (carriers) as well as from dogs that show signs of the illness.this disease can be transmitted to humans.

<p>Veterinarians are challenged when attempting. Anaerobic bacteria, or anaerobes, are bacteria that do not need oxygen to live. Anaerobic bacteria are bacteria that cannnot use oxygen in their metabolism, but are poisoned and killed by this molecule.

<p>The source of bacteria is usually contaminated water, dairy, feces or undercooked meat. Streptococcus is he common gram positive anaerobic cocci which can be found commonly in the genital parts of women and cause urinary tract infections. Bacterial disease occurs when a dog’s immune system is weakened and the bacteria is able to replicate and spread in the dog’s body. Gemella is an facultative anaerobic species and catalyse negative gram positive cocci bacteria and it is found on the surface the skin and mucous membrane of humans and some other animals too.
