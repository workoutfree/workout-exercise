High levels of the igm isotype are associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a condition in which. Whatever the results happen to be, only a medical provider can interpret its meaning and how it. Cardiolipins are lipid molecules that play an important role in the blood clotting. Cardiolipin antibodies are autoantibodies produced by the immune system that mistakenly target the body’s own cardiolipins, substances found in the outermost layer of cells (cell membranes) and platelets.

<p>Cardiolipin antibodies target cardiolipins and hence lead to recurrent blood clots in veins and arteries. The anticardiolipin blood test is useful in helping to determine if there is a risk for blood clots or help to explain clotting that has happened for some reason. Elevations of ca associated with increased risk have also been seen in idiopathic. Cardiolipins are lipid molecules that play an important role in the blood clotting.</p>
