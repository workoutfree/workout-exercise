Myocardial ischemia without symptoms (= silent ischemia = sl) has become a well known clinical entity in subjects with heart disease and in apparently healthy subjects. Diagnosis of angina is suspected if chest discomfort is typical and is precipitated by exertion and relieved by rest. Over time, the plaque build up reduces myocardial perfusion and causes ischemia as the demand for oxygen exceeds the supply. If a major artery is blocked, you may experience severe symptoms, similar to those of a heart attack or stroke.
