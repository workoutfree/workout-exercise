Ischemia or ischaemia is a restriction in blood supply to any tissues, muscle group, or organ of the body, causing a shortage of oxygen that is needed for cellular metabolism (to keep tissue alive). Coronary ischemia is linked to heart disease, and heart attacks. Learn what causes it, what the symptoms are, and how you can prevent it. It is a type of chronic, but transient, ischemia, because the chest pain appears when the person makes some effort, suffers some emotional stress or after eating, and improves within a few minutes or when resting.if left untreated, it can become a heart.
