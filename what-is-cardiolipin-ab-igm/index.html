<p>They are generally associated with a condition called the phospholipid antibody syndrome. The antiphospholipid (anticardiolipin) syndrome (aps) is characterized by recurrent venous or arterial thrombosis (clots),. The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). The test requires a blood sample that is usually taken from a vein in the arm. Comparison of IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibody values in ADHD.</p>

<p>They are generally associated with a condition called the phospholipid antibody syndrome. Igg and igm are the two most common tests performed but if the clinical impression still exists iga cardiolipin antibody testing is performed. This test is typically performed when a patient experiences unexplained blood clots, recurrent miscarriages, or autoimmune disease symptoms [ 5 ]. Cardiolipin antibodies are also called phospholipid antibodies. Low levels of IgM antibodies to oxidized cardiolipin increase and high.</p>
