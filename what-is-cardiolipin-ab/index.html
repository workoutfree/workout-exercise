When antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can form. An cardiolipin igg test looks for a certain type of antibody in your blood. The levels of these antibodies are often high in people with abnormal blood. Cardiolipin is an important component found in mitochondria.

The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps).

<p>Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of blood fat that is important for blood clotting. Slightly or moderately positive results are sometimes temporarily. More specifically, cardiolipin is a phospholipid (a type of fat) that helps form the inner wall (otherwise known as the membrane) of the mitochondria structure [ 1 ].

Cardiolipin antibodies are autoantibodies produced by the immune system that mistakenly target the body's own cardiolipins, substances found in the outermost layer of cells (cell membranes) and platelets. The antiphospholipid (anticardiolipin) syndrome (aps) is characterized by recurrent venous or arterial thrombosis (clots),.
