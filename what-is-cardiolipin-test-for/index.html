This test is typically performed when a patient experiences unexplained blood clots, recurrent miscarriages, or autoimmune disease symptoms [ 5 ]. A cardiolipin antibodies test looks for a certain kind of antibody in your blood. Tissues deprived of oxygen have a limited capacity to function; Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood that is important for blood clotting.
