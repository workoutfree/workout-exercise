<p>Compared with traditional exercise tests, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet) provides a thorough assessment of exercise integrative physiology involving the pulmonary, cardiovascular, muscular, and cellular oxidative systems. Before you start to exercise, your heart rate. Cardiopulmonary exercise test and impedance cardiography. This test is recommended for patients whose electrocardiogram, echocardiography, or spirometry results are slightly abnormal. Echocardiography Pediatrics.</p>

A cardiopulmonary stress test is also known as a cardiopulmonary exercise test. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet) is the study of responses of the cardiovascular and ventilatory systems to known exercise stress.
