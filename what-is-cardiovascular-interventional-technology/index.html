<p>They use medical technologies like ekg machines and sonography equipment to detect heart irregularities such as arterial blockages and hypertensive heart disease. Cardiovascular interventional technology (cvit) is an integral and advancing component of diagnostic and therapeutic radiologic procedures. Interventional cardiology began as a discipline after the introduction of coronary balloon angioplasty by andreas gruentzig in 1976. The cardiac function and interventional technology program seeks to instill essential knowledge, skills, and dispositions for successful careers, and servant leadership in cardiac device interventional technologies with an emphasis in cardiac rhythm management and electrophysiology.</p>
