Circulatory System Health Transformation From healthtransformation.net
This type of circulatory system has a separate systemic circulation and pulmonary circulation. In closed circulatory system, blood is transported to different parts with the help of the vessels. In open circulatory system, blood is pumped into the body cavity called haemocoel and diffuses back the blood to the heart. It is a closed network consisting of four major components:

<p>The open circulatory system, examples of which are diagrammed in figure 2, is common to molluscs and arthropods. The vital function of the circulatory system is to transport blood to all parts of the body, which is extremely important because it carries nutrients, oxygen, carbon dioxide, hormones and blood cells which are required for the nourishment and growth the cells of every organ. Your circulatory system also removes carbon dioxide and other wastes your cells do not need. In addition, its characteristics and how is its structure.</p>

The heart then sends oxygenated blood through arteries to the rest of the body. The heart (i.e., the pump) provides pressure for the blood to move through the body via the arteries and eventually into the small capillaries, where blood gas and nutrient exchange takes place.

Your circulatory system, also called the cardiovascular system or vascular system, transports oxygen, nutrients and hormones to your body's cells to use for energy, growth and repair. The vital function of the circulatory system is to transport blood to all parts of the body, which is extremely important because it carries nutrients, oxygen, carbon dioxide, hormones and blood cells which are required for the nourishment and growth the cells of every organ.

<p>Your circulatory system is critical to healthy organs, muscles and tissues. The circulatory system includes the heart, blood vessels, and blood. Circulatory systems are bodily systems used to transport nutrients, blood, gases, wastes and other materials of the body to and fro from one part to another part. Despite its small size, its entirely muscular nature allows it to constantly pumping blood at about 2 kilometers per hour, making it have enough force to reach all the organs and tissues of the body.
