The thyroid ima artery (thyroidea ima artery, arteria thyroidea ima, thyroid artery of neubauer or the lowest thyroid artery) is an artery of the head and neck. The thyroidea ima artery is an uncommon variant of the blood supply to the inferior aspect of the thyroid gland. Iliolumbar artery (arteria iliolumbalis) the iliolumbar artery arises from the posterior division/trunk of the internal iliac artery, a branch of the common iliac artery (from the abdominal aorta).it originates within the pelvic cavity and makes its way to the iliac fossa within the greater pelvis.
