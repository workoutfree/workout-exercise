Sa node, the pacemaker has the property of automaticity and rhythmicity. The filling of the ventricle (diastole) is followed by ventricular contraction (systole) to provide an adequate cardiac output during both rest and exercise to meet the body&#39;s metabolic demands. The human heart is healthy and beats at a rate of 72 times per minute, which means 72 cycles of the heart per minute. “the cardiac cycle is the performance of the human heart from the beginning of one heartbeat to the beginning of the next.

<p>Either way, the heart has systole (the time the heart is beating) and diastole (the time the heart is relaxing). A cardiac cycle is defined as the steps involving the conversion of deoxygenated blood to oxygenated blood in the lungs and pumping it by the heart to the body through the aorta [40]. The cardiac cycle is a series of heart contractions that pressurise distinct chambers of the heart, forcing blood to flow in one direction.
