Double circulation is a process during which blood passes twice through the heart during one complete cycle. Mammals have a double circulatory system. This type of circulation is found in amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Circulation of blood two times through the heart before it gets distributed throughout the body is known as double circulation.
