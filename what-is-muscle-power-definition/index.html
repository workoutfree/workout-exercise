Muscular Strength Definition, Benefits, Exercises, and More From gethealthandbeauty.com
Muscle strength should not be confused with the concept of muscular power. Training to improve power can include lifting weights. Power can be defined as force × distance/time or force × velocity ().force (i.e., strength) plays a key role in power production and if not maintained with training can result in a decrease or no change in power production. The assessment of muscle power is a key part of a neurological examination of the upper or lower limbs.
