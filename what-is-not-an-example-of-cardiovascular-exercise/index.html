<p>The aerobic system is the bodyâs ability to get energy from using oxygen to burn fat cells and carry the resultant energy to the required areas of the body. With cardio, short bouts (as short as 5 minutes each) are just as effective as longer sessions, provided the intensity level and the total cumulative workout time are equal. This is classic cardio and probably the first thing people think of when they think of. Ideally, at least 30 minutes a day, at least five days a week.</p>
