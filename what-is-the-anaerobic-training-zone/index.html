Heart Rate Zones Anerley Bicycle Club From anerleybc.org
Anaerobic training affects performance by increasing the rate at which the muscle deals with pyruvic acid and removes The anaerobic threshold is the lowest intensity of exercise at which the production of lactate exceeds the body’s ability to utilize lactate as fuel in aerobic metabolism. Longer intervals, up to 10 minutes. Training should be split 80/20 ‘easy’ and ‘hard’, even if you have limited time to dedicate to running;
