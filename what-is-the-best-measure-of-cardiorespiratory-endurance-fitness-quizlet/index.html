What Is The Best Way To Measure Intensity During Cardiovascular Fitness From tmimages.org
An increase in cardiorespiratory endurance enhances the absorption of oxygen by the lungs and heart, which can allow a person to engage in physical activity for a longer period of time. Highest oxygen consumption (vo2 max), also known as maximal oxygen consumption (moc), refers to the maximum quantity of oxygen that a person may consume when performing hard. Aerobic exercise must be of moderate intensity and combined with a moderate calorie reduction to ensure lasting weight loss. Cardiorespiratory endurance is determined by the amount of oxygen taken in by the body (vo2 max) and how efficiently it is utilised during vigorous activity.
