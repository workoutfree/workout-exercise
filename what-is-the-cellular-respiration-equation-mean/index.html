What is the overall equation of cellular respiration of glucose? Quora From quora.com
The cellular respiration equation for glycolysis is as follows: In cellular respiration,12 oxygen atoms in the glucose molecule are balanced. Oxygen is a gas that assists in cellular respiration by reacting with glucose to produce a usable form of energy. The overall equation of anaerobic respiration is:
