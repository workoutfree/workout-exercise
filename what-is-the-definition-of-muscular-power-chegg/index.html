<p>Given the proper physical definitions and formulations involved in muscular power measurement, it is concluded that although strength (force output) and power (work/time) are quantitatively related. While strength is the maximal force you can apply against a load, power is proportional to the speed at which you can apply this maximal force. Muscular power is the ability to generate as much force as possible, as quickly as possible.
