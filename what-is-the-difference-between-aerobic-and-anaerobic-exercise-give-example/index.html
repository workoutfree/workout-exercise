<p>During aerobic exercise, you breathe faster and deeper than when your heart rate is at rest. On the other hand, the oxygen demand in anaerobic exercise is much higher, resulting in increased production of lactate and shorter. The main factor that separates anaerobic activity from aerobic activity is oxygen. Types of exercises are often grouped into four different categories;</p>
