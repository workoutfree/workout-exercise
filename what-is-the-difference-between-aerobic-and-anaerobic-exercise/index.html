Difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration Science Life From meritnation.com
The main difference between aerobic and anaerobic exercise, therefore, is the requirement and usage of oxygen. The aerobic type of exercise is the one that requires the presence of oxygen. Anaerobic exercise does not use oxygen as an energy source, and it instead breaks down carbohydrates from blood glucose or stored glucose for energy. Anaerobic exercise requires a fast, high intensity pace.
