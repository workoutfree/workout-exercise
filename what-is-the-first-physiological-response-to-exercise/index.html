Summary this chapter contains sections titled: The physiological responses of the human body to exercises are mainly seen in cardiovascular systems, respiratory systems, muscular and skeletal systems and the immune system. During physical exercise, requirements for oxygen and substrate in skeletal muscle are increased, as are the removal of metabolites and carbon dioxide.

<p>An immediate change (increase or decrease) in one or more of the bodies systems in response to a stimuli. Exercise induces physiological changes such as increased ventilation, coronary vasodilation, increase in blood pressure etc. The added environmental stress changes what would normally be a low exertion activity, into one that can leave you feeling physically fatigued. At rest, our nervous system maintains a parasympathetic tone, which affects the respiratory rate, cardiac output, and various metabolic processes.</p>

Chemical, mechanical and thermal stimuli. The respiratory system • the lungs, mouth, throat and nose make up the respiratory system • one of the major functions of the respiratory system is to bring oxygen into the body and remove carbon dioxide.

<p>Physical activity and fitness are associated with a lower prevalence of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Exercise challenges many human physiological systems that need to adapt in order to maintain homeostasis, this is the inner balance of the body. Exercise is a core treatment for most physiotherapists in all specialities. The result is tachycardia, an increased stroke volume, and an increase in blood pressure.
