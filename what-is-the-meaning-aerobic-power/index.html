Aerobic respiration is the process by which organisms use oxygen to turn fuel, such as fats and sugars, into chemical energy. Atp is a multifaceted organic chemical that provides energy in. Aerobic endurance training is any form of training that uses oxygen to meet energy demands and is generally performed at a light to moderate intensity. Respiration is used by all cells to turn fuel into energy that can be used to power cellular processes.

<p>During aerobic exercise, your heart pumps oxygenated blood to working muscles to help them burn fat and carbohydrate for fuel, which in turn enables you to perform for extended periods. In fact it has three such systems and all are used simultaneously during all types of physical activity, though some more than others depending on what you’re doing. Aerobic means that the energy system needs oxygen to function. It’s a lot more complicated than this, but in essence, think of the aerobic system as using oxygen as its primary fuel source.

Improves your circulation and helps your body use oxygen better. The aerobic system, also known as aerobic glycolysis, powers continuous steady state exercise longer than three to four minutes. Aerobic respiration plays a significant role in releasing a lot of energy which helps in the survival of life. Weight Loss with Aerobic Exercise Weight Loss It's Easy.</p>
