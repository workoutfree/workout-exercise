Names are required only of the coronary arteries and of blood vessels entering and leaving the heart, liver and kidneys. The blood from the heart passes through a closed network of blood vessels to different parts of the body. Mammals and birds have a full twofold circulatory system, which allows oxygenated and deoxygenated blood to circulate independently within the heart.

<p>In mammals, as in birds, the right and left ventricles of the heart are completely separated, so that pulmonary (lung) and systemic (body) circulations are completely independent. Mammals have a double circulation/pump action. Oxygenated blood arrives in the left atrium from the lungs and passes to the left ventricle, whence it is forced through the aorta to the systemic. It is covered by an outer love covering called pericardium. Circulatory System Definition, Diagram and Functioning.</p>

<p>Although the circulatory systems of marine mammals follow the general mammalian plan, they are most notable for features associated with the diving response, thermoregulation, and large body mass. Oxygenated blood arrives in the left atrium from the lungs and passes to the left ventricle, whence it is forced through the aorta to the systemic. This is necessary due to the high energy requirements of birds and mammals. Birds, on the other hand, retain the right fourth arch.

<p>He circulatory system of birds is composed of the heart (four cavities, similar to mammals), arteries and veins that carry nutrients, oxygen, carbon dioxide,. It includes the cardiovascular system, or vascular system, that consists of the heart and blood vessels (from greek kardia meaning heart, and from latin vascula meaning vessels). Names are required only of the coronary arteries and of blood vessels entering and leaving the heart, liver and kidneys. Birds have proportionally larger hearts than mammals, meaning that the average volume occupied by a mammal's heart is 0.4% of its body mass, while in birds it is 4%.
