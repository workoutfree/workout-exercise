The normal breathing rate for an adult at rest is 12 to 20 breaths per minute. As far as the actual lesson, teachers should know that there is a direct positive relationship between respiration rate (number of breaths) and heart rate. Along with the heart, our breathing rate also increases, because along with. If the breathing rate increases, so does the pulse rate.

<p>Thus your heart pumps blood through your body faster increasing both your heart rate and your breathing rate. The more the heart beats, the more breathing occurs. Therefore the heart and breathing rate is becoming higher to enable the transportation of carbon dioxide and oxygen. In some cases, heart rate has a direct effect on blood pressure.</p>
