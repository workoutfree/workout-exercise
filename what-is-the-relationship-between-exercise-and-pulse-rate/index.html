Correlations between oxygen uptake (VO 2) and heart rate (f c From researchgate.net
There are a complex series of chemical messengers that cause the heart rate to increase if blood pressure drops too low. Heart rate and blood pressure are controlled separately. Exercise directly affects the activity, function and health of your heart. In general, a lower resting heart rate and quicker recovery in your heart rate after exercise signal better fitness.

<p>Your heart rate, or pulse, is the number of times your heart beats in a minute. The direct relationship between exercise and respiratory rate is that you will begin to take in more oxygen — about three to four times as much, to be exact. During exercise, the heart must beat faster to eliminate excess carbon dioxide and increase the supply of oxygen in the body. This is especially true at extremes, such as when heart rate is very high or blood pressure is very low.</p>

<p>Your breathing rate is measured in a similar manner, with an average resting rate of 12 to 20 breaths per minute. The more intense the exercise, the higher the heart rate.

<p>So one way to measure the intensity of your workout is to gauge how hard your heart is working. The direct relationship between exercise and respiratory rate is that you will begin to take in more oxygen — about three to four times as much, to be exact. This is why when we exercise both pulse/heart rate and breathing rate increase. If you measure your heart rate (take your pulse) before, during and after physical activity, you’ll notice it will increase over the course of the exercise.

<p>When you exercise at the highest possible intensity, your heart will reach maximal heart rate (hrmax), the fastest rate it is capable of beating. In the short term, your heart rate increases in proportion to your level of exertion as you exercise. Relationship between heart rate and pulse rate. Explain why the link between pulse rate and activity is valid. Relationship between heart rate and age in daily life in this study.</p>

<p>Exercise increases the rate at which energy is needed from food, increasing the need for both food and oxygen by the body. Your heart rate, or pulse, is the number of times your heart beats in a minute. So one way to measure the intensity of your workout is to gauge how hard your heart is working.

<p>In some cases, heart rate has a direct effect on blood pressure. The direct relationship between exercise and respiratory rate is that you will begin to take in more oxygen — about three to four times as much, to be exact.
