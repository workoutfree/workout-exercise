Cells Free FullText Role of Cardiolipin in Mitochondrial Function From mdpi.com
Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of blood fat that is important for blood clotting. The phospholipid cardiolipin (cl) is an essential constituent of mitochondrial membranes and plays a role in many mitochondrial processes, including respiration and energy conversion. Considerable progress has recently been made in understanding the role of cardiolipin in mitochondrial function and bioenergetics. Cardiolipin is a unique phospholipid that is biosynthesized in the inner mitochondrial membranes.

<p>Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them for just a short while due to an infection or drug, or present but without symptoms as a person ages. Cardiolipin (cl) is a unique mitochondrial phospholipid that, in skeletal muscle, is enriched with linoleic acid (18:2n6). Cardiolipin is a unique phospholipid that is exclusively expressed on the inner mitochondrial membrane where it plays an important structural role in cristae formation and the organization of the respiratory complexes into supercomplexes for optimal oxidative phosphorylation.
