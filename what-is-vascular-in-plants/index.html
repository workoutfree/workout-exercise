There are xylem and phloem which serve the function of the vascular system in plants. The primary vascular tissues in plants are the xylem and phloem, which are specialized, complex tissues in plants. The gametophyte is haploid, bearing only one set of chromosomes per cell. The function of the vascular system in plants is conducting dissolved food.

<p>The xylem is a tissue that supplies water throughout the parts of the plant. Vascular plants are the most common type of plant on earth, and they can be found in every habitat imaginable. The two primary vascular tissues are xylem, which transports water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the leaves, and phloem, which conducts food from the leaves to all parts of the plant.

Two kinds of vascular tissue occur in plants: The dominant generation is the sporophyte or diploid generation—many different methods for fertilization (water, wind, animals).

<p>Vascular plants include much more of the ones that are classed under angiosperms. The larger an organism is, the more complex and efficient the nutrient and water transport systems need to be. The xylem is composed of nonliving cells (tracheids and vessel elements) that are stiffened by the presence of lignin, a hardening substance that reinforces the cellulose cell wall. The leaves are like lungs collecting oxygen from the air and releasing carbon dioxide. Vascular Plants of the Gila Wilderness Helianthella parryi.</p>

<p>Vascular plants have true roots, leaves, and stems because of the vascular system. Vascular system, in vascular plants, assemblage of conducting tissues and associated supportive fibres that transport nutrients and fluids throughout the plant body.
