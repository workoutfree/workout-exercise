From venturebeat.com
The training focuses on performing quality weight training repetitions to the point of momentary muscular failure. What is considered high intensity workout? The hiit rest periods allow participants temporary relief from the high breathing demands required with higher intensity exercise, which then promotes better engagement in the bouts of high intensity movements that are needed to improve lung functioning. Such movements should match your goal and vission with your fitness.
