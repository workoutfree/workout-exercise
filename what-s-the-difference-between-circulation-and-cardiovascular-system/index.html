<p>In the open circulation, the blood is not enclosed in the blood vessels and is pumped into a cavity called hemocoel. The main difference between the two circulatory systems is the destination of the blood that's being circulated. On the contrary, in the closed circulation, the blood is pumped through the vessels separate from the interstitial fluid of the body. Since blood circulates only inside blood vessels it can do it with more pressure reaching farther distances between the organs where hematosis happens and the peripheral tissues.
