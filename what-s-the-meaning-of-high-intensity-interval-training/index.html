Why High Intensity Interval Training Stops Aging In Its Track* From kellieolver.com
You can train both the anearobic( 45 seconds) and the anarobic (10 (anaerobic alactic) system because these fuel stores are relatively small, the immediate system only supplies energy for up to about 10 se. The training works in such a way that you do this to the point where you are. A high intensity interval training program can be constituted either by aerobic exercises, such as running or cycling, or by strength exercises, which naturally requires recovery a period between exercises.it is clear, however, that both aerobic and strength exercises can be combined together to create a multitude of different training schemes. Should be the same amount as your work time.

<p>High intensity interval training is a dynamic way to get the most out of your workout. So, for example, you might run at just about full speed for ten seconds to one minute, and then jog or walk for 30 seconds all the way up to four minutes (more on ideal interval times and exercises later). For example, 30 seconds of bodyweight squats with 15 seconds rest over 8 sets is interval training. In short, it is a cardiovascular exercise strategy which alternates short periods of intense anaerobic exercise with much less intense recovery periods. Pin on Barre.</p>

<p>You can do this for 3, 4, or 5 minutes. For example, if your interval of intense exercise lasts 30 seconds, you might recover for anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds before starting your next high intensity interval. And, at intensities ranging from 80% to 140% (of vo2max ). High intensity interval training (hiit) has its roots right back in the 1950s with sprint coaches using it in on their sprint athletes with 100% hr intensities to yield quick adaptations to baseline fitness so they could spend more time on max velocity efforts.
