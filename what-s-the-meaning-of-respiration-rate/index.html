Respiratory rate (rr) is the number of breaths per minute, and it is determined in humans by counting how many times the chest rises. Respiration rate is the number of breaths per unit of time (usually per minute). Respiratory rate is the rate at which a full breathing cycle occurs, both inhalation and exhalation.

<p>Respiration rates may increase with fever, illness, and other medical conditions. The respiration rate is a parameter which is used in ecological and agronomical modeling.in theoretical production ecology and aquaculture, it typically refers to respiration per unit of time (usually loss of biomass by respiration per unit of weight), also referred to as relative respiration rate.in theoretical production ecology, biomass is expressed as dry weight, in aquaculture as. The number of breaths per minute or, more formally, the number of movements indicative of inspiration and expiration per unit time.
