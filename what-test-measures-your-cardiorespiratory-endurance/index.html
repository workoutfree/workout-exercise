<p>The following sections review the strength of the evidence for a relationship between health outcomes and the four categories of fitness tests for cardiorespiratory endurance (distance/timed run, shuttle run, treadmill, and cycle ergometer). Determine your target heart rate range for cardiovascular exercise. Both heart rate and oxygen consumption are measured in the test. Cardiorespiratory, sometimes called aerobic, fitness level is the measure of your ability to perform repetitive large muscle movement over a long period of time at moderate to high intensity.

<p>Some of the tests that can be used to measure cardiorespiratory fitness are the 2.4 km run test, the astrand treadmill test and the multistage bleep test. In addition, unlike other tests, the beep test continues to maximum effort, which can provide a more realistic picture of. Then put the minute score, the time it took. Of the 11 parts of fitness, cardiorespiratory endurance is the most important because those who have it receive many health and wellness benefits, including a chance for a longer life.
