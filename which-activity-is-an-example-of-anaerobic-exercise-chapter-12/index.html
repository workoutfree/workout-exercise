<p>Jogging 1500 meters on a track. Exercises and activities that are examples of anaerobic exercises are weightlifting, jumping rope, jumping and sprinting. This can be contrasted with anaerobic exercise such as weight lifting that uses massive amounts of oxygen in a short time such that it can't be sustained for long. Anaerobic activities do not depend on oxygen metabolism at all because the exercise intensity is high and the duration is less than 2 or 3 minutes.</p>

<p>Anaerobic exercise is significant use of muscles in a way that quickly burns oxygen. If you ignore how the muscles make use of energy for activation, you are left with which part of the muscles are involved in the activity. In fact, anaerobic means absence of oxygen. this can be contrasted with aerobic exercise that consumes oxygen at a sustainable pace such that an activity can be continued for a long duration of time.
