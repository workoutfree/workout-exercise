<p>Cardiovascular exercise is any vigorous activity that increases heart rate and respiration and raises oxygen and blood flow throughout the body while using large muscle groups of the body repetitively and rhythmically. This type of training involves intensities of around 40 to 60% of maximum heart rate. The following is a short list of the most common forms of cardiovascular exercise, with the advantages and disadvantages of each one. Cycling is another excellent form of cardiovascular exercise, utilizing many of the same muscles as running without subjecting the body to repeated impact.</p>
