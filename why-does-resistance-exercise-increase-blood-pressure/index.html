About 70% of adults in the united states are overweight. This causes the needed resistance. According to researchers, for people with a blood pressure of at least 140/90, aerobic exercise was the most effective method. Aerobic training and resistance training are the two treatment technique used in reducing systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate.

<p>How does exercise affect your blood pressure? As pco2 increases, the need of oxygen intake into the human body increases.

<p>Regular exercise, including moderate weightlifting, provides many health benefits, including helping to lower blood pressure in the long term. That means the rise in blood pressure is natural and is essential for the blood to feed the muscles with needed oxygen and to work against the resistance. It is essential to check with a doctor before starting a new exercise regimen and monitor your blood pressure throughout the physical activity to ensure it stays. Exercise reduces blood vessel stiffness, allowing blood to flow more readily. Exercise physiology from normal response to myocardial ischemia.</p>

<p>Resistance training has been less well studied. Our muscles require a bit of extra oxygen when we do exercises. I think it could be the intense arterioconstriction caused by the forceful contraction of the muscle. In people with normal blood pressure, diastolic pressure runs below 80 mm hg.

<p>Exercise can significantly improve blood pressure, including both weight &amp; aerobic training. During upright exercise, the normal blood pressure response is to observe a progressive increase in systolic blood pressure with no change or even a slight decrease in diastolic blood pressure. This blood pressure is normal and safe. Aerobic training and resistance training are the two treatment technique used in reducing systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate.

<p>In conclusion, exercising increases blood pressure because of higher heart rates and cardiac output. We reviewed the effect of resistance training on blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors in adults. You can reduce your risk of high blood pressure by losing weight. During exercise, exercising muscles produces more carbon dioxide, thus this increases the blood partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pco2) in the human body.
