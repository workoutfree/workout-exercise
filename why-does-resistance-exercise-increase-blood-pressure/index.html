About 70% of adults in the united states are overweight. This causes the needed resistance. According to researchers, for people with a blood pressure of at least 140/90, aerobic exercise was the most effective method. Aerobic training and resistance training are the two treatment technique used in reducing systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate.

<p>How does exercise affect your blood pressure? As pco2 increases, the need of oxygen intake into the human body increases.

<p>Regular exercise, including moderate weightlifting, provides many health benefits, including helping to lower blood pressure in the long term. That means the rise in blood pressure is natural and is essential for the blood to feed the muscles with needed oxygen and to work against the resistance. It is essential to check with a doctor before starting a new exercise regimen and monitor your blood pressure throughout the physical activity to ensure it stays. Exercise reduces blood vessel stiffness, allowing blood to flow more readily. Exercise physiology from normal response to myocardial ischemia.</p>

<p>In conclusion, exercising increases blood pressure because of higher heart rates and cardiac output. We reviewed the effect of resistance training on blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors in adults. You can reduce your risk of high blood pressure by losing weight. During exercise, exercising muscles produces more carbon dioxide, thus this increases the blood partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pco2) in the human body.
