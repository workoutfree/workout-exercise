<p>In other words, the heart is responsible for the effective blood circulation in the body because it has the responsibility of pumping blood. This leads to increased fatigue resistance and a greater ability to exert yourself for longer periods. The human body must pump blood throughout itself to provide oxygen and nutrients for the brain and other components for the human body to function properly. During exercise, your muscles have to work harder, which increases their demand for oxygen. Integrated Science M2 The Human Circulatory System.</p>

<p>The heart responds to the increased demand by pumping more blood through the body—this increased flow of blood results in an increased heart. During exercise, your cells use up carbon dioxide more rapidly and the heart must beat faster to deliver more carbon dioxide. The energy for muscle contraction is derived from the hydrolysis of a molecule called atp. The blood vessels of the active muscles dilate to increase the blood flow and the amount of nutrients delivered to them. &quot;Cardio&quot; Part 1 Why LowIntensity Matters Trainerize.me.</p>

Improves the muscles’ ability to pull oxygen out of the blood, reducing the need for the heart to pump more blood to the muscles. The heart uses more oxygen during exercise because it is beating harder and faster.

Because blood picks up oxygen in the lungs during exercise and the demand for oxygen rises, the lungs must work harder.
