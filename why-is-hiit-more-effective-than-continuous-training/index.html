<p>Training at such high intensity places larger demands on muscles and connective tissues, helping to strengthen them. Improves aerobic capacity (vo₂max), enhances venous return (blood’s return to the heart), increases stroke volume (amount of blood pumped in a single heartbeat) and the amount. In under 20 minutes, hiit generates increased fat metabolism that extends well beyond the period of workout. A key consideration when comparing hiit with continuous exercise is whether the same amount of calories is burned.</p>
